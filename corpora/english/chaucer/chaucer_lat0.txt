here biginneth the book of the tales of caunterbury. whan that aprille with his shoures sote the droghte of marche hath perced to the rote and bathed every veyne in swich licour of which vertu engendred is the flour; whan zephirus eek with his swete breeth  inspired hath in every holt and heeth the tendre croppes and the yonge sonne hath in the ram his halfe cours yronne and smale fowles maken melodye that slepen al the night with open ye  so priketh hem nature in hir corages: than longen folk to goon on pilgrimages and palmers for to seken straunge strondes to ferne halwes couthe in sondry londes; and specially from every shires ende  of engelond to caunterbury they wende the holy blisful martir for to seke that hem hath holpen whan that they were seke. bifel that in that seson on a day in southwerk at the tabard as i lay  redy to wenden on my pilgrimage to caunterbury with ful devout corage at night was come into that hostelrye wel nyne and twenty in a companye of sondry folk by aventure yfalle  in felawshipe and pilgrims were they alle that toward caunterbury wolden ryde; the chambres and the stables weren wyde and wel we weren esed atte beste. and shortly whan the sonne was to reste  so hadde i spoken with hem everichon that i was of hir felawshipe anon and made forward erly for to ryse to take our wey ther as i yow devyse. but natheles whyl i have tyme and space  er that i ferther in this tale pace me thinketh it acordaunt to resoun to telle yow al the condicioun of ech of hem so as it semed me and whiche they weren and of what degree;  and eek in what array that they were inne: and at a knight than wol i first biginne. a knight ther was and that a worthy man knight. that fro the tyme that he first bigan to ryden out he loved chivalrye  trouthe and honour fredom and curteisye. ful worthy was he in his lordes werre and therto hadde he riden no man ferre as wel in cristendom as hethenesse and ever honoured for his worthinesse.  at alisaundre he was whan it was wonne; ful ofte tyme he hadde the bord bigonne aboven alle naciouns in pruce. in lettow hadde he reysed and in ruce no cristen man so ofte of his degree.  in gernade at the sege eek hadde he be of algezir and riden in belmarye. at lyeys was he and at satalye whan they were wonne; and in the grete see at many a noble aryve hadde he be.  at mortal batailles hadde he been fiftene and foughten for our feith at tramissene in listes thryes and ay slayn his foo. this ilke worthy knight had been also somtyme with the lord of palatye  ageyn another hethen in turkye: and evermore he hadde a sovereyn prys. and though that he were worthy he was wys and of his port as meke as is a mayde. he never yet no vileinye ne sayde  in al his lyf unto no maner wight. he was a verray parfit gentil knight. but for to tellen yow of his array his hors were gode but he was nat gay. of fustian he wered a gipoun  al bismotered with his habergeoun; for he was late ycome from his viage and wente for to doon his pilgrimage. with him ther was his sone a yong squyer squyer. a lovyere and a lusty bacheler  with lokkes crulle as they were leyd in presse. of twenty yeer of age he was i gesse. of his stature he was of evene lengthe and wonderly deliver and greet of strengthe. and he had been somtyme in chivachye  in flaundres in artoys and picardye and born him wel as of so litel space in hope to stonden in his lady grace. embrouded was he as it were a mede al ful of fresshe floures whyte and rede.  singinge he was or floytinge al the day; he was as fresh as is the month of may. short was his goune with sleves longe and wyde. wel coude he sitte on hors and faire ryde. he coude songes make and wel endyte  iuste and eek daunce and wel purtreye and wryte so hote he lovede that by nightertale he sleep namore than dooth a nightingale. curteys he was lowly and servisable and carf biforn his fader at the table.  a yeman hadde he and servaunts namo yeman. at that tyme for him liste ryde so; and he was clad in cote and hood of grene; a sheef of pecokarwes brighte and kene under his belt he bar ful thriftily;  wel coude he dresse his takel yemanly: his arwes drouped noght with fetheres lowe and in his hand he bar a mighty bowe. a notheed hadde he with a broun visage. of wodecraft wel coude he al the usage.  upon his arm he bar a gay bracer and by his syde a swerd and a bokeler and on that other syde a gay daggere harneised wel and sharp as point of spere; a cristofre on his brest of silver shene.  an horn he bar the bawdrik was of grene; a forster was he soothly as i gesse. ther was also a nonne a prioresse prioresse. that of hir smyling was ful simple and coy; hir gretteste ooth was but by seynt loy;  and she was cleped madame eglentyne. ful wel she song the service divyne entuned in hir nose ful semely; and frensh she spak ful faire and fetisly after the scole of stratford atte bowe  for frensh of paris was to hir unknowe. at mete wel ytaught was she withalle; she leet no morsel from hir lippes falle ne wette hir fingres in hir sauce depe. wel coude she carie a morsel and wel kepe  that no drope ne fille upon hir brest. in curteisye was set ful muche hir lest. hir over lippe wyped she so clene that in hir coppe was no ferthing sene of grece whan she dronken hadde hir draughte.  ful semely after hir mete she raughte and sikerly she was of greet disport and ful plesaunt and amiable of port and peyned hir to countrefete chere of court and been estatlich of manere  and to ben holden digne of reverence. but for to speken of hir conscience she was so charitable and so pitous she wolde wepe if that she sawe a mous caught in a trappe if it were deed or bledde.  of smale houndes had she that she fedde with rosted flesh or milk and wastelbreed. but sore weep she if oon of hem were deed or if men smoot it with a yerde smerte: and al was conscience and tendre herte.  ful semely hir wimpel pinched was; hir nose tretys; hir eyen greye as glas; hir mouth ful smal and therto softe and reed; but sikerly she hadde a fair forheed; it was almost a spanne brood i trowe;  for hardily she was nat undergrowe. ful fetis was hir cloke as i was war. of smal coral aboute hir arm she bar a peire of bedes gauded al with grene; and theron heng a broche of gold ful shene  on which ther was first write a crowned a and after amor vincit omnia. another nonne with hir hadde she nonne. that was hir chapeleyne and preestes three.  preestes. a monk ther was a fair for the maistrye monk. an outrydere that lovede venerye;  a manly man to been an abbot able. ful many a deyntee hors hadde he in stable: and whan he rood men mighte his brydel here ginglen in a whistling wind as clere  and eek as loude as dooth the chapelbelle ther as this lord was keper of the celle. the reule of seint maure or of seint beneit bycause that it was old and somdel streit this ilke monk leet olde thinges pace  and held after the newe world the space. he yaf nat of that text a pulled hen that seith that hunters been nat holy men; ne that a monk whan he is cloisterlees is lykned til a fish that is waterlees;  this is to seyn a monk out of his cloistre. but thilke text held he nat worth an oistre; and i seyde his opinioun was good. what sholde he studie and make himselven wood upon a book in cloistre alwey to poure  or swinken with his handes and laboure as austin bit? how shal the world be served? lat austin have his swink to him reserved. therfore he was a pricasour aright; grehoundes he hadde as swifte as fowel in flight;  of priking and of hunting for the hare was al his lust for no cost wolde he spare. i seigh his sleves purfiled at the hond with grys and that the fyneste of a lond; and for to festne his hood under his chin  he hadde of gold ywroght a curious pin: a loveknotte in the gretter ende ther was. his heed was balled that shoon as any glas and eek his face as he had been anoint. he was a lord ful fat and in good point;  his eyen stepe and rollinge in his heed that stemed as a forneys of a leed; his botes souple his hors in greet estat. now certeinly he was a fair prelat; he was nat pale as a forpyned goost.  a fat swan loved he best of any roost. his palfrey was as broun as is a berye. a frere ther was a wantown and a merye frere. a limitour a ful solempne man. in alle the ordres foure is noon that can  so muche of daliaunce and fair langage. he hadde maad ful many a mariage of yonge wommen at his owne cost. unto his ordre he was a noble post. ful wel biloved and famulier was he  with frankeleyns overal in his contree and eek with worthy wommen of the toun: for he had power of confessioun as seyde himself more than a curat for of his ordre he was licentiat.  ful swetely herde he confessioun and plesaunt was his absolucioun; he was an esy man to yeve penaunce ther as he wiste to han a good pitaunce; for unto a povre ordre for to yive  is signe that a man is wel yshrive. for if he yaf he dorste make avaunt he wiste that a man was repentaunt. for many a man so hard is of his herte he may nat wepe althogh him sore smerte.  therfore in stede of weping and preyeres men moot yeve silver to the povre freres. his tipet was ay farsed ful of knyves and pinnes for to yeven faire wyves. and certeinly he hadde a mery note;  wel coude he singe and pleyen on a rote. of yeddinges he bar utterly the prys. his nekke whyt was as the flourdelys; therto he strong was as a champioun. he knew the tavernes wel in every toun  and everich hostiler and tappestere bet than a lazar or a beggestere; for unto swich a worthy man as he acorded nat as by his facultee to have with seke lazars aqueyntaunce.  it is nat honest it may nat avaunce for to delen with no swich poraille but al with riche and sellers of vitaille. and overal ther as profit sholde aryse curteys he was and lowly of servyse.  ther nas no man nowher so vertuous. he was the beste beggere in his hous; and yaf a certeyn ferme for the graunt;  b noon of his bretheren cam ther in his haunt;  c for thogh a widwe hadde noght a sho so plesaunt was his in principio yet wolde he have a ferthing er he wente.  his purchas was wel bettre than his rente. and rage he coude as it were right a whelpe. in lovedayes ther coude he muchel helpe.  for there he was nat lyk a cloisterer with a thredbar cope as is a povre scoler  but he was lyk a maister or a pope. of double worsted was his semicope that rounded as a belle out of the presse. somwhat he lipsed for his wantownesse to make his english swete upon his tonge;  and in his harping whan that he had songe his eyen twinkled in his heed aright as doon the sterres in the frosty night.  this worthy limitour was cleped huberd. a marchant was ther with a forked berd marchant. in mottelee and hye on horse he sat  upon his heed a flaundrish bever hat; his botes clasped faire and fetisly. his resons he spak ful solempnely souninge alway thencrees of his winning.  he wolde the see were kept for any thing bitwixe middelburgh and orewelle. wel coude he in eschaunge sheeldes selle.  this worthy man ful wel his wit bisette; ther wiste no wight that he was in dette  so estatly was he of his governaunce with his bargaynes and with his chevisaunce. for sothe he was a worthy man withalle but sooth to seyn i noot how men him calle. a clerk ther was of oxenford also clerk. that unto logik hadde longe ygo.  as lene was his hors as is a rake and he nas nat right fat i undertake;  but loked holwe and therto soberly. ful thredbar was his overest courtepy;  for he had geten him yet no benefyce ne was so worldly for to have offyce. for him was lever have at his beddes heed twenty bokes clad in blak or reed of aristotle and his philosophye  than robes riche or fithele or gay sautrye. but al be that he was a philosophre yet hadde he but litel gold in cofre;  but al that he mighte of his freendes hente on bokes and on lerninge he it spente  and bisily gan for the soules preye of hem that yaf him wherwith to scoleye. of studie took he most cure and most hede. noght o word spak he more than was nede and that was seyd in forme and reverence  and short and quik and ful of hy sentence. souninge in moral vertu was his speche and gladly wolde he lerne and gladly teche.  a sergeant of the lawe war and wys man of lawe. that often hadde been at the parvys  ther was also ful riche of excellence. discreet he was and of greet reverence: he semed swich his wordes weren so wyse. iustyce he was ful often in assyse by patente and by pleyn commissioun;  for his science and for his heigh renoun of fees and robes hadde he many oon. so greet a purchasour was nowher noon.  al was fee simple to him in effect his purchasing mighte nat been infect.  nowher so bisy a man as he ther nas and yet he semed bisier than he was. in termes hadde he caas and domes alle that from the tyme of king william were falle. therto he coude endyte and make a thing  ther coude no wight pinche at his wryting; and every statut coude he pleyn by rote. he rood but hoomly in a medlee cote  girt with a ceint of silk with barres smale; of his array telle i no lenger tale. a frankeleyn was in his companye; frankeleyn. whyt was his berd as is the dayesye. of his complexioun he was sangwyn. wel loved he by the morwe a sop in wyn. to liven in delyt was ever his wone  for he was epicurus owne sone that heeld opinioun that pleyn delyt was verraily felicitee parfyt. an housholdere and that a greet was he;  seint iulian he was in his contree. his breed his ale was alwey after oon; a bettre envyned man was nowher noon. withoute bake mete was never his hous of fish and flesh and that so plentevous it snewed in his hous of mete and drinke  of alle deyntees that men coude thinke. after the sondry sesons of the yeer so chaunged he his mete and his soper.  ful many a fat partrich hadde he in mewe and many a breem and many a luce in stewe.  wo was his cook butif his sauce were poynaunt and sharp and redy al his gere. his table dormant in his halle alway stood redy covered al the longe day. at sessiouns ther was he lord and sire;  ful ofte tyme he was knight of the shire. an anlas and a gipser al of silk heng at his girdel whyt as morne milk.  a shirreve hadde he been and a countour; was nowher such a worthy vavasour.  an haberdassher and a carpenter habaerdassher. a webbe a dyere and a tapicer carpenter. were with us eek clothed in o liveree webbe. dyere. of a solempne and greet fraternitee. tapicer. ful fresh and newe hir gere apyked was;  hir knyves were ychaped noght with bras but al with silver wroght ful clene and weel hir girdles and hir pouches everydeel.  wel semed ech of hem a fair burgeys to sitten in a yeldhalle on a deys.  everich for the wisdom that he can was shaply for to been an alderman. for catel hadde they ynogh and rente and eek hir wyves wolde it wel assente; and elles certein were they to blame.  it is ful fair to been yclept ma dame and goon to vigilyes al bifore and have a mantel royalliche ybore.  a cook they hadde with hem for the nones cook. to boille the chiknes with the marybones  and poudremarchant tart and galingale. wel coude he knowe a draughte of london ale. he coude roste and sethe and broille and frye maken mortreux and wel bake a pye. but greet harm was it as it thoughte me  that on his shine a mormal hadde he; for blankmanger that made he with the beste.  a shipman was ther woning fer by weste: shipman. for aught i woot he was of dertemouthe. he rood upon a rouncy as he couthe  in a gowne of falding to the knee. a daggere hanging on a laas hadde he aboute his nekke under his arm adoun. the hote somer had maad his hewe al broun; and certeinly he was a good felawe.  ful many a draughte of wyn had he ydrawe from burdeuxward whyl that the chapman sleep. of nyce conscience took he no keep.  if that he faught and hadde the hyer hond by water he sente hem hoom to every lond.  but of his craft to rekene wel his tydes his stremes and his daungers him bisydes his herberwe and his mone his lodemenage ther nas noon swich from hulle to cartage. hardy he was and wys to undertake;  with many a tempest hadde his berd been shake. he knew wel alle the havenes as they were from gootlond to the cape of finistere  and every cryke in britayne and in spayne; his barge ycleped was the maudelayne.  with us ther was a doctour of phisyk doctour. in al this world ne was ther noon him lyk to speke of phisik and of surgerye; for he was grounded in astronomye. he kepte his pacient a ful greet del  in houres by his magik naturel. wel coude he fortunen the ascendent of his images for his pacient.  he knew the cause of everich maladye were it of hoot or cold or moiste or drye  and where engendred and of what humour; he was a verrey parfit practisour. the cause yknowe and of his harm the rote anon he yaf the seke man his bote. ful redy hadde he his apothecaries  to sende him drogges and his letuaries for ech of hem made other for to winne; hir frendschipe nas nat newe to biginne.  wel knew he the olde esculapius and deiscorides and eek rufus  old ypocras haly and galien; serapion razis and avicen; averrois damascien and constantyn; bernard and gatesden and gilbertyn. of his diete mesurable was he  for it was of no superfluitee but of greet norissing and digestible. his studie was but litel on the bible.  in sangwin and in pers he clad was al lyned with taffata and with sendal;  and yet he was but esy of dispence; he kepte that he wan in pestilence. for gold in phisik is a cordial therfore he lovede gold in special. a good wyf was ther of bisyde bathe wyf of bathe. but she was somdel deef and that was scathe.  of cloothmaking she hadde swiche an haunt she passed hem of ypres and of gaunt.  in al the parisshe wyf ne was ther noon that to the offring bifore hir sholde goon;  and if ther dide certeyn so wrooth was she that she was out of alle charitee. hir coverchiefs ful fyne were of ground; i dorste swere they weyeden ten pound that on a sonday were upon hir heed.  hir hosen weren of fyn scarlet reed ful streite yteyd and shoos ful moiste and newe. bold was hir face and fair and reed of hewe.  she was a worthy womman al hir lyve housbondes at chirchedore she hadde fyve  withouten other companye in youthe; but therof nedeth nat to speke as nouthe. and thryes hadde she been at ierusalem; she hadde passed many a straunge streem; at rome she hadde been and at boloigne  in galice at seint iame and at coloigne. she coude muche of wandring by the weye. gattothed was she soothly for to seye.  upon an amblere esily she sat ywimpled wel and on hir heed an hat  as brood as is a bokeler or a targe; a footmantel aboute hir hipes large and on hir feet a paire of spores sharpe. in felawschip wel coude she laughe and carpe. of remedyes of love she knew perchaunce  for she coude of that art the olde daunce. a good man was ther of religioun persoun. and was a povre persoun of a toun;  but riche he was of holy thoght and werk. he was also a lerned man a clerk  that cristes gospel trewely wolde preche; his parisshens devoutly wolde he teche. benigne he was and wonder diligent and in adversitee ful pacient; and swich he was ypreved ofte sythes.  ful looth were him to cursen for his tythes but rather wolde he yeven out of doute unto his povre parisshens aboute  of his offring and eek of his substaunce. he coude in litel thing han suffisaunce.  wyd was his parisshe and houses fer asonder but he ne lafte nat for reyn ne thonder in siknes nor in meschief to visyte the ferreste in his parisshe muche and lyte upon his feet and in his hand a staf.  this noble ensample to his sheep he yaf that first he wroghte and afterward he taughte; out of the gospel he tho wordes caughte;  and this figure he added eek therto that if gold ruste what shal iren do?  for if a preest be foul on whom we truste no wonder is a lewed man to ruste; and shame it is if a preest take keep a shiten shepherde and a clene sheep. wel oghte a preest ensample for to yive  by his clennesse how that his sheep shold live. he sette nat his benefice to hyre and leet his sheep encombred in the myre  and ran to london unto seynt poules to seken him a chaunterie for soules  or with a bretherhed to been withholde; but dwelte at hoom and kepte wel his folde so that the wolf ne made it nat miscarie; he was a shepherde and no mercenarie. and though he holy were and vertuous  he was to sinful man nat despitous ne of his speche daungerous ne digne but in his teching discreet and benigne.  to drawen folk to heven by fairnesse by good ensample was his bisinesse:  but it were any persone obstinat whatso he were of heigh or lowe estat him wolde he snibben sharply for the nones. a bettre preest i trowe that nowher noon is. he wayted after no pompe and reverence  ne maked him a spyced conscience but cristes lore and his apostles twelve he taughte and first he folwed it himselve.  with him ther was a plowman was his brother plowman. that hadde ylad of dong ful many a fother  a trewe swinker and a good was he livinge in pees and parfit charitee. god loved he best with al his hole herte at alle tymes thogh him gamed or smerte and thanne his neighebour right as himselve.  he wolde thresshe and therto dyke and delve for cristes sake for every povre wight withouten hyre if it lay in his might.  his tythes payed he ful faire and wel bothe of his propre swink and his catel.  in a tabard he rood upon a mere. ther was also a reve and a millere a somnour and a pardoner also a maunciple and myself; ther were namo. the miller was a stout carl for the nones miller. ful big he was of braun and eek of bones;  that proved wel for overal ther he cam at wrastling he wolde have alwey the ram.  he was shortsholdred brood a thikke knarre ther nas no dore that he nolde heve of harre  or breke it at a renning with his heed. his berd as any sowe or fox was reed and therto brood as though it were a spade. upon the cop right of his nose he hade a werte and theron stood a tuft of heres  reed as the bristles of a sowes eres; his nosethirles blake were and wyde. a swerd and bokeler bar he by his syde;  his mouth as greet was as a greet forneys. he was a ianglere and a goliardeys  and that was most of sinne and harlotryes. wel coude he stelen corn and tollen thryes; and yet he hadde a thombe of gold pardee. a whyt cote and a blew hood wered he. a baggepype wel coude he blowe and sowne  and therwithal he broghte us out of towne. a gentil maunciple was ther of a temple maunciple. of which achatours mighte take exemple  for to be wyse in bying of vitaille. for whether that he payde or took by taille  algate he wayted so in his achat that he was ay biforn and in good stat. now is nat that of god a ful fair grace that swich a lewed mannes wit shal pace the wisdom of an heep of lerned men?  of maistres hadde he mo than thryes ten that were of lawe expert and curious; of which ther were a doseyn in that hous  worthy to been stiwardes of rente and lond of any lord that is in engelond  to make him live by his propre good in honour dettelees but he were wood or live as scarsly as him list desire; and able for to helpen al a shire in any cas that mighte falle or happe;  and yit this maunciple sette hir aller cappe. the reve was a sclendre colerik man reve. his berd was shave as ny as ever he can.  his heer was by his eres round yshorn. his top was dokked lyk a preest biforn.  ful longe were his legges and ful lene ylyk a staf ther was no calf ysene. wel coude he kepe a gerner and a binne; ther was noon auditour coude on him winne. wel wiste he by the droghte and by the reyn  the yelding of his seed and of his greyn. his lordes sheep his neet his dayerye his swyn his hors his stoor and his pultrye  was hoolly in this reves governing and by his covenaunt yaf the rekening  sin that his lord was twenty yeer of age; ther coude no man bringe him in arrerage. ther nas baillif ne herde ne other hyne that he ne knew his sleighte and his covyne; they were adrad of him as of the deeth.  his woning was ful fair upon an heeth with grene trees shadwed was his place. he coude bettre than his lord purchace.  ful riche he was astored prively his lord wel coude he plesen subtilly  to yeve and lene him of his owne good and have a thank and yet a cote and hood. in youthe he lerned hadde a good mister; he was a wel good wrighte a carpenter. this reve sat upon a ful good stot  that was al pomely grey and highte scot. a long surcote of pers upon he hade and by his syde he bar a rusty blade.  of northfolk was this reve of which i telle bisyde a toun men clepen baldeswelle.  tukked he was as is a frere aboute and ever he rood the hindreste of our route. a somnour was ther with us in that place somnour. that hadde a fyrreed cherubinnes face for sawcefleem he was with eyen narwe.  as hoot he was and lecherous as a sparwe; with scalled browes blake and piled berd; of his visage children were aferd.  ther nas quiksilver litarge ne brimstoon boras ceruce ne oille of tartre noon  ne oynement that wolde dense and byte that him mighte helpen of his whelkes whyte nor of the knobbes sittinge on his chekes. wel loved he garleek oynons and eek lekes and for to drinken strong wyn reed as blood.  thanne wolde he speke and crye as he were wood. and whan that he wel dronken hadde the wyn than wolde he speke no word but latyn.  a fewe termes hadde he two or three that he had lerned out of som decree;  no wonder is he herde it al the day; and eek ye knowen wel how that a iay can clepen watte as well as can the pope. but whoso coude in other thing him grope thanne hadde he spent al his philosophye;  ay questio quid iuris wolde he crye. he was a gentil harlot and a kinde; a bettre felawe sholde men noght finde.  he wolde suffre for a quart of wyn a good felawe to have his concubyn  a twelfmonth and excuse him atte fulle: ful prively a finch eek coude he pulle. and if he fond owher a good felawe he wolde techen him to have non awe in swich cas of the erchedeknes curs  butif a mannes soule were in his purs; for in his purs he sholde ypunisshed be. purs is the erchedeknes helle seyde he.  but wel i woot he lyed right in dede; of cursing oghte ech gilty man him drede  for curs wol slee right as assoilling saveth and also war him of a significavit. in daunger hadde he at his owne gyse the yonge girles of the diocyse and knew hir counseil and was al hir reed.  a gerland hadde he set upon his heed as greet as it were for an alestake; a bokeler hadde he maad him of a cake.  with him ther rood a gentil pardoner pardoner. of rouncival his freend and his compeer  that streight was comen fro the court of rome. ful loude he song com hider love to me. this somnour bar to him a stif burdoun was never trompe of half so greet a soun. this pardoner hadde heer as yelow as wex  but smothe it heng as dooth a strike of flex; by ounces henge his lokkes that he hadde and therwith he his shuldres overspradde;  but thinne it lay by colpons oon and oon; but hood for iolitee ne wered he noon  for it was trussed up in his walet. him thoughte he rood al of the newe iet;

 of athenes he was lord and governour and in his tyme swich a conquerour that gretter was ther noon under the sonne. ful many a riche contree hadde he wonne; what with his wisdom and his chivalrye  he conquered al the regne of femenye that whylom was ycleped scithia; and weddede the quene ipolita  and broghte hir hoom with him in his contree with muchel glorie and greet solempnitee  and eek hir yonge suster emelye. and thus with victorie and with melodye lete i this noble duk to athenes ryde and al his hoost in armes him bisyde. and certes if it nere to long to here  i wolde han told yow fully the manere how wonnen was the regne of femenye by theseus and by his chivalrye;  and of the grete bataille for the nones bitwixen athenes and amazones;  and how asseged was ipolita the faire hardy quene of scithia; and of the feste that was at hir weddinge and of the tempest at hir hoomcominge; but al that thing i moot as now forbere.  i have god woot a large feeld to ere and wayke been the oxen in my plough. the remenant of the tale is long ynough.  i wol nat letten eek noon of this route; lat every felawe telle his tale aboute  and lat see now who shal the soper winne; and ther i lefte i wol ageyn biginne. this duk of whom i make mencioun when he was come almost unto the toun in al his wele and in his moste pryde  he was war as he caste his eye asyde wher that ther kneled in the hye weye a companye of ladies tweye and tweye  ech after other clad in clothes blake; but swich a cry and swich a wo they make  that in this world nis creature livinge that herde swich another weymentinge; and of this cry they nolde never stenten til they the reynes of his brydel henten. what folk ben ye that at myn hoomcominge  perturben so my feste with cryinge? quod theseus have ye so greet envye of myn honour that thus compleyne and crye?  or who hath yow misboden or offended? and telleth me if it may been amended;  and why that ye ben clothed thus in blak? the eldest lady of hem alle spak when she hadde swowned with a deedly chere that it was routhe for to seen and here and seyde: lord to whom fortune hath yiven  victorie and as a conquerour to liven noght greveth us your glorie and your honour; but we biseken mercy and socour.  have mercy on our wo and our distresse. som drope of pitee thurgh thy gentillesse  upon us wrecched wommen lat thou falle. for certes lord ther nis noon of us alle that she nath been a duchesse or a quene; now be we caitifs as it is wel sene: thanked be fortune and hir false wheel  that noon estat assureth to be weel. and certes lord to abyden your presence here in the temple of the goddesse clemence  we han ben waytinge al this fourtenight; now help us lord sith it is in thy might.  i wrecche which that wepe and waille thus was whylom wyf to king capaneus that starf at thebes cursed be that day! and alle we that been in this array and maken al this lamentacioun  we losten alle our housbondes at that toun whyl that the sege theraboute lay. and yet now the olde creon weylaway!  that lord is now of thebes the citee fulfild of ire and of iniquitee  he for despyt and for his tirannye to do the dede bodyes vileinye of alle our lordes whiche that ben slawe hath alle the bodyes on an heep ydrawe and wol nat suffren hem by noon assent  neither to been yburied nor ybrent but maketh houndes ete hem in despyt. and with that word withouten more respyt  they fillen gruf and cryden pitously have on us wrecched wommen som mercy  and lat our sorwe sinken in thyn herte. this gentil duk doun from his courser sterte with herte pitous whan he herde hem speke. him thoughte that his herte wolde breke whan he saugh hem so pitous and so mat  that whylom weren of so greet estat. and in his armes he hem alle up hente and hem conforteth in ful good entente;  and swoor his ooth as he was trewe knight he wolde doon so ferforthly his might  upon the tyraunt creon hem to wreke that al the peple of grece sholde speke how creon was of theseus yserved as he that hadde his deeth ful wel deserved. and right anoon withouten more abood  his baner he desplayeth and forth rood to thebesward and al his host bisyde; no neer athenes wolde he go ne ryde  ne take his ese fully half a day but onward on his wey that night he lay;  and sente anoon ipolita the quene and emelye hir yonge suster shene unto the toun of athenes to dwelle; and forth he rit; ther nis namore to telle. the rede statue of mars with spere and targe  so shyneth in his whyte baner large that alle the feeldes gliteren up and doun; and by his baner born is his penoun  of gold ful riche in which ther was ybete the minotaur which that he slough in crete.  thus rit this duk thus rit this conquerour and in his host of chivalrye the flour til that he cam to thebes and alighte faire in a feeld ther as he thoghte fighte. but shortly for to speken of this thing  with creon which that was of thebes king he faught and slough him manly as a knight in pleyn bataille and putte the folk to flight;  and by assaut he wan the citee after and rente adoun bothe wal and sparre and rafter;  and to the ladyes he restored agayn the bones of hir housbondes that were slayn to doon obsequies as was tho the gyse. but it were al to long for to devyse the grete clamour and the waymentinge  that the ladyes made at the brenninge of the bodyes and the grete honour that theseus the noble conquerour  doth to the ladyes whan they from him wente; but shortly for to telle is myn entente.  whan that this worthy duk this theseus hath creon slayn and wonne thebes thus stille in that feeld he took al night his reste and dide with al the contree as him leste. to ransake in the tas of bodyes dede  hem for to strepe of harneys and of wede the pilours diden bisinesse and cure after the bataille and disconfiture.  and so bifel that in the tas they founde thurghgirt with many a grevous blody wounde  two yonge knightes ligging by and by bothe in oon armes wroght ful richely of whiche two arcita hight that oon and that other knight hight palamon. nat fully quike ne fully dede they were  but by hir cotearmures and by hir gere the heraudes knewe hem best in special as they that weren of the blood royal  of thebes and of sustren two yborn. out of the tas the pilours han hem torn  and han hem caried softe unto the tente of theseus and he ful sone hem sente to athenes to dwellen in prisoun perpetuelly he nolde no raunsoun. and whan this worthy duk hath thus ydon  he took his host and hoom he rood anon with laurer crowned as a conquerour; and there he liveth in ioye and in honour  terme of his lyf; what nedeth wordes mo? and in a tour in angwish and in wo  dwellen this palamoun and eek arcite for evermore ther may no gold hem quyte. this passeth yeer by yeer and day by day til it fil ones in a morwe of may that emelye that fairer was to sene  than is the lilie upon his stalke grene and fressher than the may with floures newe for with the rose colour stroof hir hewe  i noot which was the fairer of hem two er it were day as was hir wone to do  she was arisen and al redy dight; for may wol have no slogardye anight. the sesoun priketh every gentil herte and maketh him out of his sleep to sterte and seith arys and do thyn observaunce.  this maked emelye have remembraunce to doon honour to may and for to ryse. yclothed was she fresh for to devyse;  hir yelow heer was broyded in a tresse bihinde hir bak a yerde long i gesse.  and in the gardin at the sonne upriste she walketh up and doun and as hir liste she gadereth floures party whyte and rede to make a sotil gerland for hir hede and as an aungel hevenly she song.  the grete tour that was so thikke and strong which of the castel was the chief dongeoun theras the knightes weren in prisoun  of whiche i tolde yow and tellen shal was evene ioynant to the gardinwal  ther as this emelye hadde hir pleyinge. bright was the sonne and cleer that morweninge and palamon this woful prisoner as was his wone by leve of his gayler was risen and romed in a chambre on heigh  in which he al the noble citee seigh and eek the gardin ful of braunches grene theras this fresshe emelye the shene  was in hir walk and romed up and doun. this sorweful prisoner this palamoun  goth in the chambre roming to and fro and to himself compleyning of his wo; that he was born ful ofte he seyde alas! and so bifel by aventure or cas that thurgh a window thikke of many a barre  of yren greet and square as any sparre he caste his eye upon emelya and therwithal he bleynte and cryde a!  as though he stongen were unto the herte. and with that cry arcite anon upsterte  and seyde cosin myn what eyleth thee that art so pale and deedly on to see? why crydestow? who hath thee doon offence? for goddes love tak al in pacience our prisoun for it may non other be;  fortune hath yeven us this adversitee. som wikke aspect or disposicioun of saturne by sum constellacioun  hath yeven us this although we hadde it sworn; so stood the heven whan that we were born;  we moste endure it: this is the short and pleyn. this palamon answerde and seyde ageyn cosyn for sothe of this opinioun thou hast a veyn imaginacioun. this prison caused me nat for to crye.  but i was hurt right now thurghout myn ye into myn herte that wol my bane be. the fairnesse of that lady that i see  yond in the gardin romen to and fro is cause of al my crying and my wo.  i noot wher she be womman or goddesse; but venus is it soothly as i gesse. and therwithal on knees doun he fil and seyde: venus if it be thy wil yow in this gardin thus to transfigure  bifore me sorweful wrecche creature out of this prisoun help that we may scapen. and if so be my destinee be shapen  by eterne word to dyen in prisoun of our linage have som compassioun  that is so lowe ybroght by tirannye. and with that word arcite gan espye wheras this lady romed to and fro. and with that sighte hir beautee hurte him so that if that palamon was wounded sore  arcite is hurt as muche as he or more. and with a sigh he seyde pitously: the fresshe beautee sleeth me sodeynly  of hir that rometh in the yonder place; and but i have hir mercy and hir grace  that i may seen hir atte leeste weye i nam but deed; ther nis namore to seye. this palamon whan he tho wordes herde dispitously he loked and answerde: whether seistow this in ernest or in pley?  nay quod arcite in ernest by my fey! god help me so me list ful yvele pleye. this palamon gan knitte his browes tweye:  it nere quod he to thee no greet honour for to be fals ne for to be traytour  to me that am thy cosin and thy brother ysworn ful depe and ech of us til other that never for to dyen in the peyne til that the deeth departe shal us tweyne neither of us in love to hindren other  ne in non other cas my leve brother; but that thou sholdest trewely forthren me in every cas and i shal forthren thee.  this was thyn ooth and myn also certeyn; i wot right wel thou darst it nat withseyn.  thus artow of my counseil out of doute. and now thou woldest falsly been aboute to love my lady whom i love and serve and ever shal til that myn herte sterve. now certes fals arcite thou shalt nat so.  i loved hir first and tolde thee my wo as to my counseil and my brother sworn to forthre me as i have told biforn.  for which thou art ybounden as a knight to helpen me if it lay in thy might  or elles artow fals i dar wel seyn. this arcite ful proudly spak ageyn thou shalt quod he be rather fals than i; but thou art fals i telle thee utterly; for par amour i loved hir first er thow.  what wiltow seyn? thou wistest nat yet now whether she be a womman or goddesse! thyn is affeccioun of holinesse  and myn is love as to a creature; for which i tolde thee myn aventure  as to my cosin and my brother sworn. i pose that thou lovedest hir biforn; wostow nat wel the olde clerkes sawe that who shal yeve a lover any lawe? love is a gretter lawe by my pan  than may be yeve to any erthly man. and therefore positif lawe and swich decree is broke alday for love in ech degree.  a man moot nedes love maugree his heed. he may nat fleen it thogh he sholde be deed  al be she mayde or widwe or elles wyf. and eek it is nat lykly al thy lyf to stonden in hir grace; namore shal i; for wel thou woost thyselven verraily that thou and i be dampned to prisoun  perpetuelly; us gayneth no raunsoun. we stryve as dide the houndes for the boon they foughte al day and yet hir part was noon;  ther cam a kyte whyl that they were wrothe and bar awey the boon bitwixe hem bothe.  and therfore at the kinges court my brother ech man for himself ther is non other. love if thee list; for i love and ay shal; and soothly leve brother this is al. here in this prisoun mote we endure  and everich of us take his aventure. greet was the stryf and long bitwixe hem tweye if that i hadde leyser for to seye;  but to theffect. it happed on a day to telle it yow as shortly as i may  a worthy duk that highte perotheus that felawe was unto duk theseus sin thilke day that they were children lyte was come to athenes his felawe to visyte and for to pleye as he was wont to do  for in this world he loved no man so: and he loved him as tendrely ageyn. so wel they loved as olde bokes seyn  that whan that oon was deed sothly to telle his felawe wente and soghte him doun in helle;  but of that story list me nat to wryte. duk perotheus loved wel arcite and hadde him knowe at thebes yeer by yere; and fynally at requeste and preyere of perotheus withoute any raunsoun  duk theseus him leet out of prisoun freely to goon wher that him liste overal in swich a gyse as i you tellen shal.  this was the forward pleynly for tendyte bitwixen theseus and him arcite:  that if so were that arcite were yfounde ever in his lyf by day or night or stounde in any contree of this theseus and he were caught it was acorded thus that with a swerd he sholde lese his heed;  ther nas non other remedye ne reed but taketh his leve and homward he him spedde; let him be war his nekke lyth to wedde!  how greet a sorwe suffreth now arcite! the deeth he feleth thurgh his herte smyte;  he wepeth wayleth cryeth pitously; to sleen himself he wayteth prively. he seyde allas that day that i was born! now is my prison worse than biforn; now is me shape eternally to dwelle  noght in purgatorie but in helle. allas! that ever knew i perotheus! for elles hadde i dwelled with theseus  yfetered in his prisoun evermo. than hadde i been in blisse and nat in wo.  only the sighte of hir whom that i serve though that i never hir grace may deserve wolde han suffised right ynough for me. o dere cosin palamon quod he thyn is the victorie of this aventure  ful blisfully in prison maistow dure; in prison? certes nay but in paradys! wel hath fortune yturned thee the dys  that hast the sighte of hir and i thabsence. for possible is sin thou hast hir presence  and art a knight a worthy and an able that by som cas sin fortune is chaungeable thou mayst to thy desyr somtyme atteyne. but i that am exyled and bareyne of alle grace and in so greet despeir  that ther nis erthe water fyr ne eir ne creature that of hem maked is that may me helpe or doon confort in this.  wel oughte i sterve in wanhope and distresse; farwel my lyf my lust and my gladnesse!  allas why pleynen folk so in commune of purveyaunce of god or of fortune that yeveth hem ful ofte in many a gyse wel bettre than they can hemself devyse? som man desyreth for to han richesse  that cause is of his mordre or greet siknesse. and som man wolde out of his prison fayn that in his hous is of his meynee slayn.  infinite harmes been in this matere; we witen nat what thing we preyen here.  we faren as he that dronke is as a mous; a dronke man wot wel he hath an hous but he noot which the righte wey is thider; and to a dronke man the wey is slider. and certes in this world so faren we;  we seken faste after felicitee but we goon wrong ful often trewely. thus may we seyen alle and namely i  that wende and hadde a greet opinioun that if i mighte escapen from prisoun  than hadde i been in ioye and perfit hele ther now i am exyled fro my wele. sin that i may nat seen yow emelye i nam but deed; ther nis no remedye. upon that other syde palamon  whan that he wiste arcite was agon swich sorwe he maketh that the grete tour resouneth of his youling and clamour.  the pure fettres on his shines grete weren of his bittre salte teres wete.  allas! quod he arcita cosin myn of al our stryf god woot the fruyt is thyn. thow walkest now in thebes at thy large and of my wo thou yevest litel charge. thou mayst sin thou hast wisdom and manhede  assemblen alle the folk of our kinrede and make a werre so sharp on this citee that by som aventure or som tretee  thou mayst have hir to lady and to wyf for whom that i mot nedes lese my lyf.  for as by wey of possibilitee sith thou art at thy large of prison free and art a lord greet is thyn avauntage more than is myn that sterve here in a cage. for i mot wepe and wayle whyl i live  with al the wo that prison may me yive and eek with peyne that love me yiveth also that doubleth al my torment and my wo.  therwith the fyr of ielousye upsterte withinne his brest and hente him by the herte  so woodly that he lyk was to biholde the boxtree or the asshen dede and colde. tho seyde he; o cruel goddes that governe this world with binding of your word eterne and wryten in the table of athamaunt  your parlement and your eterne graunt what is mankinde more unto yow holde than is the sheep that rouketh in the folde?  for slayn is man right as another beste and dwelleth eek in prison and areste  and hath siknesse and greet adversitee and ofte tymes giltelees pardee! what governaunce is in this prescience that giltelees tormenteth innocence? and yet encreseth this al my penaunce  that man is bounden to his observaunce for goddes sake to letten of his wille ther as a beest may al his lust fulfille.  and whan a beest is deed he hath no peyne; but man after his deeth moot wepe and pleyne  though in this world he have care and wo: withouten doute it may stonden so. the answere of this i lete to divynis but wel i woot that in this world gret pyne is. allas! i see a serpent or a theef  that many a trewe man hath doon mescheef goon at his large and wher him list may turne. but i mot been in prison thurgh saturne  and eek thurgh iuno ialous and eek wood that hath destroyed wel ny al the blood  of thebes with his waste walles wyde. and venus sleeth me on that other syde for ielousye and fere of him arcite. now wol i stinte of palamon a lyte and lete him in his prison stille dwelle  and of arcita forth i wol yow telle. the somer passeth and the nightes longe encresen double wyse the peynes stronge  bothe of the lovere and the prisoner. i noot which hath the wofullere mester.  for shortly for to seyn this palamoun perpetuelly is dampned to prisoun in cheynes and in fettres to ben deed; and arcite is exyled upon his heed for evermo as out of that contree  ne nevermo he shal his lady see. yow loveres axe i now this questioun who hath the worse arcite or palamoun?  that oon may seen his lady day by day but in prison he moot dwelle alway.  that other wher him list may ryde or go but seen his lady shal he nevermo. now demeth as yow liste ye that can for i wol telle forth as i bigan. explicit prima pars. sequitur pars secunda. whan that arcite to thebes comen was  ful ofte a day he swelte and seyde allas for seen his lady shal he nevermo. and shortly to concluden al his wo  so muche sorwe had never creature that is or shal whyl that the world may dure.  his sleep his mete his drink is him biraft that lene he wex and drye as is a shaft. his eyen holwe and grisly to biholde; his hewe falwe and pale as asshen colde and solitarie he was and ever allone  and wailling al the night making his mone. and if he herde song or instrument then wolde he wepe he mighte nat be stent;  so feble eek were his spirits and so lowe and chaunged so that no man coude knowe  his speche nor his vois though men it herde. and in his gere for al the world he ferde nat oonly lyk the loveres maladye of hereos but rather lyk manye engendred of humour malencolyk  biforen in his celle fantastyk. and shortly turned was al upsodoun bothe habit and eek disposicioun  of him this woful lovere daun arcite. what sholde i alday of his wo endyte?  whan he endured hadde a yeer or two this cruel torment and this peyne and wo at thebes in his contree as i seyde upon a night in sleep as he him leyde him thoughte how that the winged god mercurie  biforn him stood and bad him to be murye. his slepy yerde in hond he bar uprighte; an hat he werede upon his heres brighte.  arrayed was this god as he took keep as he was whan that argus took his sleep;  and seyde him thus: to athenes shaltou wende; ther is thee shapen of thy wo an ende. and with that word arcite wook and sterte. now trewely how sore that me smerte quod he to athenes right now wol i fare;  ne for the drede of deeth shal i nat spare to see my lady that i love and serve; in hir presence i recche nat to sterve.  and with that word he caughte a greet mirour and saugh that chaunged was al his colour  and saugh his visage al in another kinde. and right anoon it ran him in his minde that sith his face was so disfigured of maladye the which he hadde endured he mighte wel if that he bar him lowe  live in athenes evermore unknowe and seen his lady wel ny day by day. and right anon he chaunged his array  and cladde him as a povre laborer and al allone save oonly a squyer  that knew his privetee and al his cas which was disgysed povrely as he was to athenes is he goon the nexte way. and to the court he wente upon a day and at the gate he profreth his servyse  to drugge and drawe what so men wol devyse. and shortly of this matere for to seyn he fil in office with a chamberleyn  the which that dwelling was with emelye. for he was wys and coude soon aspye  of every servaunt which that serveth here. wel coude he hewen wode and water bere for he was yong and mighty for the nones and therto be was strong and big of bones to doon that any wight can him devyse.  a yeer or two he was in this servyse page of the chambre of emelye the brighte; and philostrate he seide that he highte.  but half so wel biloved a man as he ne was ther never in court of his degree;  he was so gentil of condicioun that thurghout al the court was his renoun. they seyden that it were a charitee that theseus wolde enhauncen his degree and putten him in worshipful servyse  ther as he mighte his vertu excercyse. and thus withinne a whyle his name is spronge bothe of his dedes and his goode tonge  that theseus hath taken him so neer that of his chambre he made him a squyer  and yaf him gold to mayntene his degree; and eek men broghte him out of his contree from yeer to yeer ful prively his rente; but honestly and slyly he it spente that no man wondred how that he it hadde.  and three yeer in this wyse his lyf he ladde and bar him so in pees and eek in werre ther nas no man that theseus hath derre.  and in this blisse lete i now arcite and speke i wol of palamon a lyte.  in derknesse and horrible and strong prisoun this seven yeer hath seten palamoun forpyned what for wo and for distresse; who feleth double soor and hevinesse but palamon? that love destreyneth so  that wood out of his wit he gooth for wo; and eek therto he is a prisoner perpetuelly noght oonly for a yeer.  who coude ryme in english proprely his martirdom? for sothe it am nat i;  therefore i passe as lightly as i may. it fel that in the seventhe yeer in may the thridde night as olde bokes seyn that al this storie tellen more pleyn were it by aventure or destinee  as whan a thing is shapen it shal be that sone after the midnight palamoun by helping of a freend brak his prisoun  and fleeth the citee faste as he may go; for he had yive his gayler drinke so  of a clarree maad of a certeyn wyn with nercotikes and opie of thebes fyn that al that night thogh that men wolde him shake the gayler sleep he mighte nat awake; and thus he fleeth as faste as ever he may.  the night was short and faste by the day that nedescost he moste himselven hyde and til a grove faste ther besyde  with dredful foot than stalketh palamoun. for shortly this was his opinioun  that in that grove he wolde him hyde al day and in the night than wolde he take his way to thebesward his freendes for to preye on theseus to helpe him to werreye; and shortly outher he wolde lese his lyf  or winnen emelye unto his wyf; this is theffect and his entente pleyn. now wol i torne unto arcite ageyn  that litel wiste how ny that was his care til that fortune had broght him in the snare.  the bisy larke messager of day salueth in hir song the morwe gray; and fyry phebus ryseth up so brighte that al the orient laugheth of the lighte and with his stremes dryeth in the greves  the silver dropes hanging on the leves. and arcite that is in the court royal with theseus his squyer principal  is risen and loketh on the myrie day. and for to doon his observaunce to may  remembring on the poynt of his desyr he on a courser sterting as the fyr is riden into the feeldes him to pleye out of the court were it a myle or tweye; and to the grove of which that i yow tolde  by aventure his wey he gan to holde to maken him a gerland of the greves were it of wodebinde or hawethornleves  and loude he song ageyn the sonne shene: may with alle thy floures and thy grene  welcome be thou faire fresshe may i hope that i som grene gete may. and from his courser with a lusty herte into the grove ful hastily he sterte and in a path he rometh up and doun  theras by aventure this palamoun was in a bush that no man mighte him see for sore afered of his deeth was he.  nothing ne knew he that it was arcite: god wot he wolde have trowed it ful lyte.  but sooth is seyd gon sithen many yeres that feeld hath eyen and the wode hath eres. it is ful fair a man to bere him evene for alday meteth men at unset stevene. ful litel woot arcite of his felawe  that was so ny to herknen al his sawe for in the bush he sitteth now ful stille. whan that arcite had romed al his fille  and songen al the roundel lustily into a studie he fil sodeynly  as doon thise loveres in hir queynte geres now in the croppe now doun in the breres now up now doun as boket in a welle. right as the friday soothly for to telle now it shyneth now it reyneth faste  right so can gery venus overcaste the hertes of hir folk; right as hir day is gerful right so chaungeth she array.  selde is the friday al the wyke ylyke. whan that arcite had songe he gan to syke  and sette him doun withouten any more: alas! quod he that day that i was bore! how longe iuno thurgh thy crueltee woltow werreyen thebes the citee? allas! ybroght is to confusioun  the blood royal of cadme and amphioun; of cadmus which that was the firste man that thebes bulte or first the toun bigan  and of the citee first was crouned king of his linage am i and his ofspring  by verray ligne as of the stok royal: and now i am so caitif and so thral that he that is my mortal enemy i serve him as his squyer povrely. and yet doth iuno me wel more shame  for i dar noght biknowe myn owne name; but theras i was wont to highte arcite now highte i philostrate noght worth a myte.  allas! thou felle mars allas! iuno thus hath your ire our kinrede al fordo  save only me and wrecched palamoun that theseus martyreth in prisoun. and over al this to sleen me utterly love hath his fyry dart so brenningly ystiked thurgh my trewe careful herte  that shapen was my deeth erst than my sherte. ye sleen me with your eyen emelye; ye been the cause wherfor that i dye.  of al the remenant of myn other care ne sette i nat the mountaunce of a tare  so that i coude don aught to your plesaunce! and with that word he fil doun in a traunce a longe tyme; and after he upsterte. this palamoun that thoughte that thurgh his herte he felte a cold swerd sodeynliche glyde  for ire he quook no lenger wolde he byde. and whan that he had herd arcites tale as he were wood with face deed and pale  he sterte him up out of the buskes thikke and seyde: arcite false traitour wikke  now artow hent that lovest my lady so for whom that i have al this peyne and wo and art my blood and to my counseil sworn as i ful ofte have told thee heerbiforn and hast byiaped here duk theseus  and falsly chaunged hast thy name thus; i wol be deed or elles thou shalt dye. thou shalt nat love my lady emelye  but i wol love hir only and namo; for i am palamoun thy mortal fo.  and though that i no wepne have in this place but out of prison am astert by grace i drede noght that outher thou shalt dye or thou ne shalt nat loven emelye. chees which thou wilt for thou shalt nat asterte.  this arcite with ful despitous herte whan he him knew and hadde his tale herd as fiers as leoun pulled out a swerd  and seyde thus: by god that sit above nere it that thou art sik and wood for love  and eek that thou no wepne hast in this place thou sholdest never out of this grove pace that thou ne sholdest dyen of myn hond. for i defye the seurtee and the bond which that thou seyst that i have maad to thee.  what verray fool think wel that love is free and i wol love hir maugre al thy might! but for as muche thou art a worthy knight  and wilnest to darreyne hir by batayle have heer my trouthe tomorwe i wol nat fayle  withouten witing of any other wight that here i wol be founden as a knight and bringen harneys right ynough for thee; and chees the beste and leve the worste for me. and mete and drinke this night wol i bringe  ynough for thee and clothes for thy beddinge. and if so be that thou my lady winne and slee me in this wode ther i am inne  thou mayst wel have thy lady as for me. this palamon answerde: i graunte it thee.  and thus they been departed til amorwe when ech of hem had leyd his feith to borwe. o cupide out of alle charitee! o regne that wolt no felawe have with thee! ful sooth is seyd that love ne lordshipe  wol noght his thankes have no felaweshipe; wel finden that arcite and palamoun. arcite is riden anon unto the toun  and on the morwe er it were dayes light ful prively two harneys hath he dight  bothe suffisaunt and mete to darreyne the bataille in the feeld bitwix hem tweyne. and on his hors allone as he was born he carieth al this harneys him biforn; and in the grove at tyme and place yset  this arcite and this palamon ben met. tho chaungen gan the colour in hir face; right as the hunter in the regne of trace  that stondeth at the gappe with a spere whan hunted is the leoun or the bere  and hereth him come russhing in the greves and breketh bothe bowes and the leves and thinketh heer cometh my mortel enemy withoute faile he moot be deed or i; for outher i mot sleen him at the gappe  or he mot sleen me if that me mishappe: so ferden they in chaunging of hir hewe as fer as everich of hem other knewe.  ther nas no good day ne no saluing; but streight withouten word or rehersing  everich of hem halp for to armen other as freendly as he were his owne brother; and after that with sharpe speres stronge they foynen ech at other wonder longe. thou mightest wene that this palamoun  in his fighting were a wood leoun and as a cruel tygre was arcite: as wilde bores gonne they to smyte  that frothen whyte as foom for ire wood. up to the ancle foghte they in hir blood.  and in this wyse i lete hem fighting dwelle; and forth i wol of theseus yow telle. the destinee ministre general that executeth in the world overal the purveyaunce that god hath seyn biforn  so strong it is that though the world had sworn the contrarie of a thing by ye or nay yet somtyme it shal fallen on a day  that falleth nat eft withinne a thousand yere. for certeinly our appetytes here  be it of werre or pees or hate or love al is this reuled by the sighte above. this mene i now by mighty theseus that for to honten is so desirous and namely at the grete hert in may  that in his bed ther daweth him no day that he nis clad and redy for to ryde with hunte and horn and houndes him bisyde.  for in his hunting hath he swich delyt that it is al his ioye and appetyt  to been himself the grete hertes bane; for after mars he serveth now diane. cleer was the day as i have told er this and theseus with alle ioye and blis with his ipolita the fayre quene  and emelye clothed al in grene on hunting be they riden royally. and to the grove that stood ful faste by  in which ther was an hert as men him tolde duk theseus the streighte wey hath holde.  and to the launde he rydeth him ful right for thider was the hert wont have his flight and over a brook and so forth on his weye. this duk wol han a cours at him or tweye with houndes swiche as that him list comaunde.  and whan this duk was come unto the launde under the sonne he loketh and anon he was war of arcite and palamon  that foughten breme as it were bores two; the brighte swerdes wenten to and fro  so hidously that with the leeste strook it seemed as it wolde felle an ook; but what they were nothing he ne woot. this duk his courser with his spores smoot and at a stert he was bitwix hem two  and pulled out a swerd and cryed ho! namore up peyne of lesing of your heed. by mighty mars he shal anon be deed  that smyteth any strook that i may seen! but telleth me what mister men ye been  that been so hardy for to fighten here withouten iuge or other officere as it were in a listes royally? this palamon answerde hastily and seyde: sire what nedeth wordes mo?  we have the deeth deserved bothe two. two woful wrecches been we two caytyves that been encombred of our owne lyves;  and as thou art a rightful lord and iuge ne yeve us neither mercy ne refuge  but slee me first for seynte charitee; but slee my felawe eek as wel as me. or slee him first; for though thou knowe it lyte this is thy mortal fo this is arcite that fro thy lond is banished on his heed  for which he hath deserved to be deed. for this is he that cam unto thy gate and seyde that he highte philostrate.  thus hath he iaped thee ful many a yeer and thou has maked him thy chief squyer;  and this is he that loveth emelye. for sith the day is come that i shal dye i make pleynly my confessioun that i am thilke woful palamoun that hath thy prison broken wikkedly.  i am thy mortal fo and it am i that loveth so hote emelye the brighte that i wol dye present in hir sighte.  therfore i axe deeth and my iuwyse; but slee my felawe in the same wyse  for bothe han we deserved to be slayn. this worthy duk answerde anon agayn and seyde this is a short conclusioun: youre owne mouth by your confessioun hath dampned you and i wol it recorde  it nedeth noght to pyne yow with the corde. ye shul be deed by mighty mars the rede! the quene anon for verray wommanhede  gan for to wepe and so dide emelye and alle the ladies in the companye.  gret pitee was it as it thoughte hem alle that ever swich a chaunce sholde falle; for gentil men they were of greet estat and nothing but for love was this debat; and sawe hir blody woundes wyde and sore;  and alle cryden bothe lasse and more have mercy lord upon us wommen alle! and on hir bare knees adoun they falle  and wolde have kist his feet theras he stood til at the laste aslaked was his mood;  for pitee renneth sone in gentil herte. and though he first for ire quook and sterte he hath considered shortly in a clause the trespas of hem bothe and eek the cause: and although that his ire hir gilt accused  yet in his reson he hem bothe excused; as thus: he thoghte wel that every man wol helpe himself in love if that he can  and eek delivere himself out of prisoun; and eek his herte had compassioun  of wommen for they wepen ever in oon; and in his gentil herte he thoghte anoon and softe unto himself he seyde: fy upon a lord that wol have no mercy but been a leoun bothe in word and dede  to hem that been in repentaunce and drede as wel as to a proud despitous man that wol maynteyne that he first bigan!  that lord hath litel of discrecioun that in swich cas can no divisioun  but weyeth pryde and humblesse after oon. and shortly whan his ire is thus agoon he gan to loken up with eyen lighte and spak thise same wordes al on highte: the god of love a! benedicite  how mighty and how greet a lord is he! ayeins his might ther gayneth none obstacles he may be cleped a god for his miracles;  for he can maken at his owne gyse of everich herte as that him list devyse.  lo heer this arcite and this palamoun that quitly weren out of my prisoun and mighte han lived in thebes royally and witen i am hir mortal enemy and that hir deeth lyth in my might also  and yet hath love maugree hir eyen two ybroght hem hider bothe for to dye! now loketh is nat that an heigh folye?  who may been a fool butif he love? bihold for goddes sake that sit above  se how they blede! be they noght wel arrayed? thus hath hir lord the god of love ypayed hir wages and hir fees for hir servyse! and yet they wenen for to been ful wyse that serven love for aught that may bifalle!  but this is yet the beste game of alle that she for whom they han this iolitee can hem therfor as muche thank as me;  she woot namore of al this hote fare by god than woot a cokkow or an hare!  but al mot been assayed hoot and cold; a man mot been a fool or yong or old; i woot it by myself ful yore agoon: for in my tyme a servant was i oon. and therfore sin i knowe of loves peyne  and woot how sore it can a man distreyne as he that hath ben caught ofte in his las i yow foryeve al hoolly this trespas  at requeste of the quene that kneleth here and eek of emelye my suster dere.  and ye shul bothe anon unto me swere that nevermo ye shul my contree dere ne make werre upon me night ne day but been my freendes in al that ye may; i yow foryeve this trespas every del.  and they him swore his axing fayre and wel and him of lordshipe and of mercy preyde and he hem graunteth grace and thus he seyde:  to speke of royal linage and richesse though that she were a quene or a princesse  ech of yow bothe is worthy doutelees to wedden whan tyme is but nathelees i speke as for my suster emelye for whom ye have this stryf and ielousye; ye woot yourself she may not wedden two  at ones though ye fighten evermo: that oon of yow al be him looth or leef he moot go pypen in an ivyleef;  this is to seyn she may nat now han bothe al be ye never so ielous ne so wrothe.  and forthy i yow putte in this degree that ech of yow shal have his destinee as him is shape; and herkneth in what wyse; lo heer your ende of that i shal devyse. my wil is this for plat conclusioun  withouten any replicacioun if that yow lyketh tak it for the beste that everich of yow shal gon wher him leste  frely withouten raunson or daunger; and this day fifty wykes fer ne ner  everich of yow shal bringe an hundred knightes armed for listes up at alle rightes al redy to darreyne hir by bataille. and this bihote i yow withouten faille upon my trouthe and as i am a knight  that whether of yow bothe that hath might this is to seyn that whether he or thou may with his hundred as i spak of now  sleen his contrarie or out of listes dryve him shal i yeve emelya to wyve  to whom that fortune yeveth so fair a grace. the listes shal i maken in this place and god so wisly on my soule rewe as i shal even iuge been and trewe. ye shul non other ende with me maken  that oon of yow ne shal be deed or taken. and if yow thinketh this is wel ysayd seyeth your avys and holdeth yow apayd.  this is your ende and your conclusioun. who loketh lightly now but palamoun?  who springeth up for ioye but arcite? who couthe telle or who couthe it endyte the ioye that is maked in the place whan theseus hath doon so fair a grace? but doun on knees wente every maner wight  and thanked him with al her herte and might and namely the thebans ofte sythe. and thus with good hope and with herte blythe  they take hir leve and homward gonne they ryde to thebes with his olde walles wyde.  explicit secunda pars. sequitur pars tercia. i trowe men wolde deme it necligence if i foryete to tellen the dispence of theseus that goth so bisily to maken up the listes royally; that swich a noble theatre as it was  i dar wel seyn that in this world ther nas. the circuit a myle was aboute walled of stoon and diched al withoute.  round was the shap in maner of compas ful of degrees the heighte of sixty pas  that whan a man was set on o degree he letted nat his felawe for to see. estward ther stood a gate of marbel whyt westward right swich another in the opposit. and shortly to concluden swich a place  was noon in erthe as in so litel space; for in the lond ther nas no crafty man that geometrie or arsmetrik can  ne purtreyour ne kerver of images that theseus ne yaf him mete and wages  the theatre for to maken and devyse. and for to doon his ryte and sacrifyse he estward hath upon the gate above in worship of venus goddesse of love don make an auter and an oratorie;  and westward in the minde and in memorie of mars he maked hath right swich another that coste largely of gold a fother.  and northward in a touret on the wal of alabastre whyt and reed coral  an oratorie riche for to see in worship of dyane of chastitee hath theseus don wroght in noble wyse. but yet hadde i foryeten to devyse the noble kerving and the portreitures  the shap the countenaunce and the figures that weren in thise oratories three. first in the temple of venus maystow see  wroght on the wal ful pitous to biholde the broken slepes and the sykes colde;  the sacred teres and the waymenting; the fyry strokes of the desiring that loves servaunts in this lyf enduren; the othes that hir covenants assuren; plesaunce and hope desyr foolhardinesse  beautee and youthe bauderie richesse charmes and force lesinges flaterye dispense bisynesse and ielousye  that wered of yelwe goldes a gerland and a cokkow sitting on hir hand;  festes instruments caroles daunces lust and array and alle the circumstaunces of love whiche that i rekne and rekne shal by ordre weren peynted on the wal and mo than i can make of mencioun.  for soothly al the mount of citheroun ther venus hath hir principal dwelling was shewed on the wal in portreying  with al the gardin and the lustinesse. nat was foryeten the porter ydelnesse  ne narcisus the faire of yore agon ne yet the folye of king salamon ne yet the grete strengthe of hercules thenchauntements of medea and circes ne of turnus with the hardy fiers corage  the riche cresus caytif in servage. thus may ye seen that wisdom ne richesse beautee ne sleighte strengthe ne hardinesse  ne may with venus holde champartye; for as hir list the world than may she gye.  lo alle thise folk so caught were in hir las til they for wo ful ofte seyde allas! suffyceth heer ensamples oon or two and though i coude rekne a thousand mo. the statue of venus glorious for to see  was naked fleting in the large see and fro the navele doun all covered was with wawes grene and brighte as any glas.  a citole in hir right hand hadde she and on hir heed ful semely for to see  a rose gerland fresh and wel smellinge; above hir heed hir dowves flikeringe. biforn hir stood hir sone cupido upon his shuldres winges hadde he two; and blind he was as it is ofte sene;  a bowe he bar and arwes brighte and kene. why sholde i noght as wel eek telle yow al the portreiture that was upon the wal  withinne the temple of mighty mars the rede? al peynted was the wal in lengthe and brede  lyk to the estres of the grisly place that highte the grete temple of mars in trace in thilke colde frosty regioun theras mars hath his sovereyn mansioun. first on the wal was peynted a foreste  in which ther dwelleth neither man ne beste with knotty knarry bareyn trees olde of stubbes sharpe and hidous to biholde;  in which ther ran a rumbel and a swough as though a storm sholde bresten every bough:  and downward from an hille under a bente ther stood the temple of mars armipotente wroght al of burned steel of which thentree was long and streit and gastly for to see. and therout cam a rage and such a vese  that it made al the gates for to rese. the northren light in at the dores shoon for windowe on the wal ne was ther noon  thurgh which men mighten any light discerne. the dores were alle of adamant eterne  yclenched overthwart and endelong with iren tough; and for to make it strong every piler the temple to sustene was tonnegreet of iren bright and shene. ther saugh i first the derke imagining  of felonye and al the compassing; the cruel ire reed as any glede; the pykepurs and eek the pale drede;  the smyler with the knyf under the cloke; the shepne brenning with the blake smoke;  the treson of the mordring in the bedde; the open werre with woundes al bibledde; contek with blody knyf and sharp manace; al ful of chirking was that sory place. the sleere of himself yet saugh i ther  his herteblood hath bathed al his heer; the nayl ydriven in the shode anight; the colde deeth with mouth gaping upright.  amiddes of the temple sat meschaunce with disconfort and sory contenaunce.  yet saugh i woodnesse laughing in his rage; armed compleint outhees and fiers outrage. the careyne in the bush with throte ycorve: a thousand slayn and nat of qualm ystorve; the tiraunt with the prey by force yraft;  the toun destroyed ther was nothing laft. yet saugh i brent the shippes hoppesteres; the hunte strangled with the wilde beres:  the sowe freten the child right in the cradel; the cook yscalded for al his longe ladel.  noght was foryeten by the infortune of marte; the carter overriden with his carte under the wheel ful lowe he lay adoun. ther were also of martes divisioun the barbour and the bocher and the smith  that forgeth sharpe swerdes on his stith. and al above depeynted in a tour saw i conquest sittinge in greet honour  with the sharpe swerde over his heed hanginge by a sotil twynes threed.  depeynted was the slaughtre of iulius of grete nero and of antonius; al be that thilke tyme they were unborn yet was hir deeth depeynted therbiforn by manasinge of mars right by figure;  so was it shewed in that portreiture as is depeynted in the sterres above who shal be slayn or elles deed for love.  suffyceth oon ensample in stories olde i may not rekne hem alle thogh i wolde.  the statue of mars upon a carte stood armed and loked grim as he were wood; and over his heed ther shynen two figures of sterres that been cleped in scriptures that oon puella that other rubeus.  this god of armes was arrayed thus: a wolf ther stood biforn him at his feet with eyen rede and of a man he eet;  with sotil pencel was depeynt this storie in redoutinge of mars and of his glorie.  now to the temple of diane the chaste as shortly as i can i wol me haste to telle yow al the descripcioun. depeynted been the walles up and doun of hunting and of shamfast chastitee.  ther saugh i how woful calistopee whan that diane agreved was with here was turned from a womman til a bere  and after was she maad the lodesterre; thus was it peynt i can say yow no ferre;  hir sone is eek a sterre as men may see. ther saugh i dane yturned til a tree i mene nat the goddesse diane but penneus doughter which that highte dane. ther saugh i attheon an hert ymaked  for vengeaunce that he saugh diane al naked; i saugh how that his houndes have him caught and freten him for that they knewe him naught.  yet peynted was a litel forthermoor how atthalante hunted the wilde boor  and meleagre and many another mo for which diane wroghte him care and wo. ther saugh i many another wonder storie the whiche me list nat drawen to memorie. this goddesse on an hert ful hye seet  with smale houndes al aboute hir feet; and undernethe hir feet she hadde a mone wexing it was and sholde wanie sone.  in gaude grene hir statue clothed was with bowe in honde and arwes in a cas.  hir eyen caste she ful lowe adoun ther pluto hath his derke regioun. a womman travailinge was hir biforn but for hir child so longe was unborn ful pitously lucyna gan she calle  and seyde help for thou mayst best of alle. wel couthe he peynten lyfly that it wroghte with many a florin he the hewes boghte.  now been thise listes maad and theseus that at his grete cost arrayed thus  the temples and the theatre every del whan it was doon him lyked wonder wel. but stinte i wol of theseus a lyte and speke of palamon and of arcite. the day approcheth of hir retourninge  that everich sholde an hundred knightes bringe the bataille to darreyne as i yow tolde; and til athenes hir covenant for to holde  hath everich of hem broght an hundred knightes wel armed for the werre at alle rightes.  and sikerly ther trowed many a man that never sithen that the world bigan as for to speke of knighthod of hir hond as fer as god hath maked see or lond nas of so fewe so noble a companye.  for every wight that lovede chivalrye and wolde his thankes han a passant name hath preyed that he mighte ben of that game;  and wel was him that therto chosen was. for if ther fille tomorwe swich a cas  ye knowen wel that every lusty knight that loveth paramours and hath his might were it in engelond or elleswhere they wolde hir thankes wilnen to be there. to fighte for a lady benedicite!  it were a lusty sighte for to see. and right so ferden they with palamon. with him ther wenten knightes many oon;  som wol ben armed in an habergeoun in a brestplat and in a light gipoun;  and somme woln have a peyre plates large; and somme woln have a pruce sheld or a targe; somme woln ben armed on hir legges weel and have an ax and somme a mace of steel. ther nis no newe gyse that it nas old.  armed were they as i have you told everich after his opinioun. ther maistow seen coming with palamoun  ligurge himself the grete king of trace; blak was his berd and manly was his face.  the cercles of his eyen in his heed they gloweden bitwixe yelow and reed; and lyk a griffon loked he aboute with kempe heres on his browes stoute; his limes grete his braunes harde and stronge  his shuldres brode his armes rounde and longe. and as the gyse was in his contree ful hye upon a char of gold stood he  with foure whyte boles in the trays. instede of cotearmure over his harnays  with nayles yelwe and brighte as any gold he hadde a beres skin colblak forold. his longe heer was kembd bihinde his bak as any ravenes fether it shoon forblak: a wrethe of gold armgreet of huge wighte  upon his heed set ful of stones brighte of fyne rubies and of dyamaunts. aboute his char ther wenten whyte alaunts  twenty and mo as grete as any steer to hunten at the leoun or the deer  and folwed him with mosel faste ybounde colers of gold and torets fyled rounde. an hundred lordes hadde he in his route armed ful wel with hertes sterne and stoute. with arcita in stories as men finde  the grete emetreus the king of inde upon a stede bay trapped in steel covered in cloth of gold diapred weel  cam ryding lyk the god of armes mars. his cotearmure was of cloth of tars  couched with perles whyte and rounde and grete. his sadel was of brend gold newe ybete; a mantelet upon his shuldre hanginge bretful of rubies rede as fyr sparklinge. his crispe heer lyk ringes was yronne  and that was yelow and glitered as the sonne. his nose was heigh his eyen bright citryn his lippes rounde his colour was sangwyn  a fewe fraknes in his face yspreynd betwixen yelow and somdel blak ymeynd  and as a leoun he his loking caste. of fyve and twenty yeer his age i caste. his berd was wel bigonne for to springe; his voys was as a trompe thunderinge. upon his heed he wered of laurer grene  a gerland fresh and lusty for to sene. upon his hand he bar for his deduyt an egle tame as eny lilie whyt.  an hundred lordes hadde he with him there al armed sauf hir heddes in al hir gere  ful richely in alle maner thinges. for trusteth wel that dukes erles kinges were gadered in this noble companye for love and for encrees of chivalrye. aboute this king ther ran on every part  ful many a tame leoun and lepart. and in this wyse thise lordes alle and some ben on the sonday to the citee come  aboute pryme and in the toun alight. this theseus this duk this worthy knight  whan he had broght hem into his citee and inned hem everich in his degree he festeth hem and dooth so greet labour to esen hem and doon hem al honour that yet men weneth that no mannes wit  of noon estat ne coude amenden it. the minstralcye the service at the feste the grete yiftes to the moste and leste  the riche array of theseus paleys ne who sat first ne last upon the deys  what ladies fairest been or best daunsinge or which of hem can dauncen best and singe ne who most felingly speketh of love: what haukes sitten on the perche above what houndes liggen on the floor adoun:  of al this make i now no mencioun; but al theffect that thinketh me the beste; now comth the poynt and herkneth if yow leste.  the sonday night er day bigan to springe when palamon the larke herde singe  although it nere nat day by houres two yet song the larke and palamon also. with holy herte and with an heigh corage he roos to wenden on his pilgrimage unto the blisful citherea benigne  i mene venus honurable and digne. and in hir houre he walketh forth a pas unto the listes ther hir temple was  and doun he kneleth and with humble chere and herte soor he seyde as ye shul here.  faireste of faire o lady myn venus doughter to iove and spouse of vulcanus thou glader of the mount of citheroun for thilke love thou haddest to adoun have pitee of my bittre teres smerte  and tak myn humble preyer at thyn herte. allas! i ne have no langage to telle theffectes ne the torments of myn helle;  myn herte may myne harmes nat biwreye; i am so confus that i can noght seye.  but mercy lady bright that knowest weel my thought and seest what harmes that i feel considere al this and rewe upon my sore as wisly as i shal for evermore emforth my might thy trewe servant be  and holden werre alwey with chastitee; that make i myn avow so ye me helpe. i kepe noght of armes for to yelpe  ne i ne axe nat tomorwe to have victorie ne renoun in this cas ne veyne glorie  of pris of armes blowen up and doun but i wolde have fully possessioun of emelye and dye in thy servyse; find thou the maner how and in what wyse. i recche nat but it may bettre be  to have victorie of hem or they of me so that i have my lady in myne armes. for though so be that mars is god of armes  your vertu is so greet in hevene above that if yow list i shal wel have my love  thy temple wol i worshipe evermo and on thyn auter wher i ryde or go i wol don sacrifice and fyres bete. and if ye wol nat so my lady swete than preye i thee tomorwe with a spere  that arcita me thurgh the herte bere. thanne rekke i noght whan i have lost my lyf though that arcita winne hir to his wyf.  this is theffect and ende of my preyere yif me my love thou blisful lady dere.  whan thorisoun was doon of palamon his sacrifice he dide and that anon ful pitously with alle circumstaunces al telle i noght as now his observaunces. but atte laste the statue of venus shook  and made a signe wherby that he took that his preyere accepted was that day. for thogh the signe shewed a delay  yet wiste he wel that graunted was his bone; and with glad herte he wente him hoom ful sone.  the thridde houre inequal that palamon bigan to venus temple for to goon up roos the sonne and up roos emelye and to the temple of diane gan hye. hir maydens that she thider with hir ladde  ful redily with hem the fyr they hadde thencens the clothes and the remenant al that to the sacrifyce longen shal;  the hornes fulle of meth as was the gyse; ther lakked noght to doon hir sacrifyse.  smoking the temple ful of clothes faire this emelye with herte debonaire hir body wessh with water of a welle; but how she dide hir ryte i dar nat telle but it be any thing in general;  and yet it were a game to heren al; to him that meneth wel it were no charge: but it is good a man ben at his large.  hir brighte heer was kempt untressed al; a coroune of a grene ook cerial  upon hir heed was set ful fair and mete. two fyres on the auter gan she bete and dide hir thinges as men may biholde in stace of thebes and thise bokes olde. whan kindled was the fyr with pitous chere  unto diane she spak as ye may here. o chaste goddesse of the wodes grene to whom bothe hevene and erthe and see is sene  quene of the regne of pluto derk and lowe goddesse of maydens that myn herte hast knowe  ful many a yeer and woost what i desire as keep me fro thy vengeaunce and thyn ire that attheon aboughte cruelly. chaste goddesse wel wostow that i desire to been a mayden al my lyf  ne never wol i be no love ne wyf. i am thou woost yet of thy companye a mayde and love hunting and venerye  and for to walken in the wodes wilde and noght to been a wyf and be with childe.  noght wol i knowe companye of man. now help me lady sith ye may and can for tho thre formes that thou hast in thee. and palamon that hath swich love to me and eek arcite that loveth me so sore  this grace i preye thee withoute more as sende love and pees bitwixe hem two; and fro me turne awey hir hertes so  that al hir hote love and hir desyr and al hir bisy torment and hir fyr  be queynt or turned in another place; and if so be thou wolt not do me grace or if my destinee be shapen so that i shal nedes have oon of hem two as sende me him that most desireth me.  bihold goddesse of clene chastitee the bittre teres that on my chekes falle. sin thou are mayde and keper of us alle  my maydenhede thou kepe and wel conserve and whyl i live a mayde i wol thee serve.  the fyres brenne upon the auter clere whyl emelye was thus in hir preyere; but sodeinly she saugh a sighte queynte for right anon oon of the fyres queynte and quiked agayn and after that anon  that other fyr was queynt and al agon; and as it queynte it made a whistelinge as doon thise wete brondes in hir brenninge  and at the brondes ende outran anoon as it were blody dropes many oon;  for which so sore agast was emelye that she was wel ny mad and gan to crye for she ne wiste what it signifyed; but only for the fere thus hath she cryed and weep that it was pitee for to here.  and therwithal diane gan appere with bowe in hond right as an hunteresse and seyde: doghter stint thyn hevinesse.  among the goddes hye it is affermed and by eterne word write and confermed  thou shalt ben wedded unto oon of tho that han for thee so muchel care and wo; but unto which of hem i may nat telle. farwel for i ne may no lenger dwelle. the fyres which that on myn auter brenne  shul thee declaren er that thou go henne thyn aventure of love as in this cas. and with that word the arwes in the cas  of the goddesse clateren faste and ringe and forth she wente and made a vanisshinge;  for which this emelye astoned was and seyde what amounteth this allas! i putte me in thy proteccioun diane and in thy disposicioun. and hoom she gooth anon the nexte weye.  this is theffect ther is namore to seye. the nexte houre of mars folwinge this arcite unto the temple walked is  of fierse mars to doon his sacrifyse with alle the rytes of his payen wyse.  with pitous herte and heigh devocioun right thus to mars he seyde his orisoun: o stronge god that in the regnes colde of trace honoured art and lord yholde and hast in every regne and every lond  of armes al the brydel in thyn hond and hem fortunest as thee list devyse accept of me my pitous sacrifyse.  if so be that my youthe may deserve and that my might be worthy for to serve  thy godhede that i may been oon of thyne than preye i thee to rewe upon my pyne. for thilke peyne and thilke hote fyr in which thou whylom brendest for desyr whan that thou usedest the grete beautee  of fayre yonge fresshe venus free and haddest hir in armes at thy wille although thee ones on a tyme misfille  whan vulcanus had caught thee in his las and fond thee ligging by his wyf allas!  for thilke sorwe that was in thyn herte have routhe as wel upon my peynes smerte. i am yong and unkonning as thou wost and as i trowe with love offended most that ever was any lyves creature;  for she that dooth me al this wo endure ne reccheth never wher i sinke or flete. and wel i woot er she me mercy hete  i moot with strengthe winne hir in the place; and wel i woot withouten help or grace  of thee ne may my strengthe noght availle. than help me lord tomorwe in my bataille for thilke fyr that whylom brente thee as wel as thilke fyr now brenneth me; and do that i tomorwe have victorie.  myn be the travaille and thyn be the glorie! thy soverein temple wol i most honouren of any place and alwey most labouren  in thy plesaunce and in thy craftes stronge and in thy temple i wol my baner honge  and alle the armes of my companye; and everemo unto that day i dye eterne fyr i wol biforn thee finde. and eek to this avow i wol me binde: my berd myn heer that hongeth long adoun  that never yet ne felte offensioun of rasour nor of shere i wol thee yive and ben thy trewe servant whyl i live.  now lord have routhe upon my sorwes sore yif me victorie i aske thee namore.  the preyere stinte of arcita the stronge the ringes on the templedore that honge and eek the dores clatereden ful faste of which arcita somwhat him agaste. the fyres brende upon the auter brighte  that it gan al the temple for to lighte; and swete smel the ground anon upyaf and arcita anon his hand uphaf  and more encens into the fyr he caste with othere rytes mo; and atte laste  the statue of mars bigan his hauberk ringe. and with that soun he herde a murmuringe ful lowe and dim that sayde thus victorie: for which he yaf to mars honour and glorie. and thus with ioye and hope wel to fare  arcite anon unto his inne is fare as fayn as fowel is of the brighte sonne. and right anon swich stryf ther is bigonne  for thilke graunting in the hevene above bitwixe venus the goddesse of love  and mars the sterne god armipotente that iupiter was bisy it to stente; til that the pale saturnus the colde that knew so manye of aventures olde fond in his olde experience an art  that he ful sone hath plesed every part. as sooth is sayd elde hath greet avantage; in elde is bothe wisdom and usage;  men may the olde atrenne and noght atrede. saturne anon to stinten stryf and drede  al be it that it is agayn his kynde of al this stryf he gan remedie fynde. my dere doghter venus quod saturne my cours that hath so wyde for to turne hath more power than wot any man.  myn is the drenching in the see so wan; myn is the prison in the derke cote; myn is the strangling and hanging by the throte;  the murmure and the cherles rebelling the groyning and the pryvee empoysoning:  i do vengeance and pleyn correccioun whyl i dwelle in the signe of the leoun. myn is the ruine of the hye halles the falling of the toures and of the walles upon the mynour or the carpenter.  i slow sampsoun in shaking the piler;

weep thou namore i wol thy lust fulfille.  now wol i stinten of the goddes above of mars and of venus goddesse of love  and telle yow as pleynly as i can the grete effect for which that i bigan. explicit tercia pars. sequitur pars quarta. greet was the feste in athenes that day and eek the lusty seson of that may made every wight to been in swich plesaunce  that al that monday iusten they and daunce and spenden it in venus heigh servyse. but by the cause that they sholde ryse  erly for to seen the grete fight unto hir reste wente they at night.  and on the morwe whan that day gan springe of hors and harneys noyse and clateringe ther was in hostelryes al aboute; and to the paleys rood ther many a route of lordes upon stedes and palfreys.  ther maystow seen devysing of herneys so uncouth and so riche and wroght so weel of goldsmithrie of browding and of steel;  the sheeldes brighte testers and trappures; goldhewen helmes hauberks cotearmures;  lordes in paraments on hir courseres knightes of retenue and eek squyeres nailinge the speres and helmes bokelinge gigginge of sheeldes with layneres lacinge; ther as need is they weren nothing ydel;  the fomy stedes on the golden brydel gnawinge and faste the armurers also with fyle and hamer prikinge to and fro;  yemen on fote and communes many oon with shorte staves thikke as they may goon;  pypes trompes nakers clariounes that in the bataille blowen blody sounes; the paleys ful of peples up and doun heer three ther ten holding hir questioun divyninge of thise thebane knightes two.  somme seyden thus somme seyde it shal be so; somme helden with him with the blake berd somme with the balled somme with the thikkeherd;  somme sayde he loked grim and he wolde fighte; he hath a sparth of twenty pound of wighte.  thus was the halle ful of divyninge longe after that the sonne gan to springe. the grete theseus that of his sleep awaked with minstralcye and noyse that was maked held yet the chambre of his paleys riche  til that the thebane knightes bothe yliche honoured were into the paleys fet. duk theseus was at a window set  arrayed right as he were a god in trone. the peple preesseth thiderward ful sone  him for to seen and doon heigh reverence and eek to herkne his hest and his sentence. an heraud on a scaffold made an ho til al the noyse of the peple was ydo; and whan he saugh the peple of noyse al stille  tho showed he the mighty dukes wille. the lord hath of his heigh discrecioun considered that it were destruccioun  to gentil blood to fighten in the gyse of mortal bataille now in this empryse;  wherfore to shapen that they shul not dye he wol his firste purpos modifye. no man therfor up peyne of los of lyf no maner shot ne pollax ne short knyf into the listes sende or thider bringe;  ne short swerd for to stoke with poynt bytinge no man ne drawe ne bere it by his syde. ne no man shal unto his felawe ryde  but o cours with a sharp ygrounde spere; foyne if him list on fote himself to were.  and he that is at meschief shal be take and noght slayn but be broght unto the stake that shal ben ordeyned on either syde; but thider he shal by force and ther abyde. and if so falle the chieftayn be take  on either syde or elles slee his make no lenger shal the turneyinge laste. god spede yow; goth forth and ley on faste.  with long swerd and with maces fight your fille. goth now your wey; this is the lordes wille.  the voys of peple touchede the hevene so loude cryden they with mery stevene: god save swich a lord that is so good he wilneth no destruccioun of blood! up goon the trompes and the melodye.  and to the listes rit the companye by ordinaunce thurghout the citee large hanged with cloth of gold and nat with sarge.  ful lyk a lord this noble duk gan ryde thise two thebanes upon either syde;  and after rood the quene and emelye and after that another companye of oon and other after hir degree. and thus they passen thurghout the citee and to the listes come they by tyme.  it nas not of the day yet fully pryme whan set was theseus ful riche and hye ipolita the quene and emelye  and other ladies in degrees aboute. unto the seetes preesseth al the route.  and westward thurgh the gates under marte arcite and eek the hundred of his parte with baner reed is entred right anon; and in that selve moment palamon is under venus estward in the place  with baner whyt and hardy chere and face. in al the world to seken up and doun so even withouten variacioun  ther nere swiche companyes tweye. for ther nas noon so wys that coude seye  that any hadde of other avauntage of worthinesse ne of estaat ne age so even were they chosen for to gesse. and in two renges faire they hem dresse. whan that hir names rad were everichoon  that in hir nombre gyle were ther noon tho were the gates shet and cryed was loude: do now your devoir yonge knightes proude!  the heraudes lefte hir priking up and doun; now ringen trompes loude and clarioun;  ther is namore to seyn but west and est in goon the speres ful sadly in arest; in goth the sharpe spore into the syde. ther seen men who can iuste and who can ryde; ther shiveren shaftes upon sheeldes thikke;  he feleth thurgh the hertespoon the prikke. up springen speres twenty foot on highte; out goon the swerdes as the silver brighte.  the helmes they tohewen and toshrede; out brest the blood with sterne stremes rede.  with mighty maces the bones they tobreste. he thurgh the thikkeste of the throng gan threste. ther stomblen stedes stronge and doun goth al. he rolleth under foot as dooth a bal. he foyneth on his feet with his tronchoun  and he him hurtleth with his hors adoun. he thurgh the body is hurt and sithen ytake maugree his heed and broght unto the stake  as forward was right ther he moste abyde; another lad is on that other syde.  and som tyme dooth hem theseus to reste hem to refresshe and drinken if hem leste. ful ofte aday han thise thebanes two togidre ymet and wroght his felawe wo; unhorsed hath ech other of hem tweye.  ther nas no tygre in the vale of galgopheye whan that hir whelp is stole whan it is lyte so cruel on the hunte as is arcite  for ielous herte upon this palamoun: ne in belmarye ther nis so fel leoun  that hunted is or for his hunger wood ne of his praye desireth so the blood as palamon to sleen his fo arcite. the ielous strokes on hir helmes byte; out renneth blood on bothe hir sydes rede.  som tyme an ende ther is of every dede; for er the sonne unto the reste wente the stronge king emetreus gan hente  this palamon as he faught with arcite and made his swerd depe in his flesh to byte;  and by the force of twenty is he take unyolden and ydrawe unto the stake. and in the rescous of this palamoun the stronge king ligurge is born adoun; and king emetreus for al his strengthe  is born out of his sadel a swerdes lengthe so hitte him palamon er he were take; but al for noght he was broght to the stake.  his hardy herte mighte him helpe naught; he moste abyde whan that he was caught  by force and eek by composicioun. who sorweth now but woful palamoun that moot namore goon agayn to fighte? and whan that theseus had seyn this sighte unto the folk that foghten thus echoon  he cryde ho! namore for it is doon! i wol be trewe iuge and no partye. arcite of thebes shal have emelye  that by his fortune hath hir faire ywonne. anon ther is a noyse of peple bigonne  for ioye of this so loude and heigh withalle it semed that the listes sholde falle. what can now faire venus doon above? what seith she now? what dooth this quene of love? but wepeth so for wanting of hir wille  til that hir teres in the listes fille; she seyde: i am ashamed doutelees. saturnus seyde: doghter hold thy pees.  mars hath his wille his knight hath al his bone and by myn heed thou shalt ben esed sone.  the trompes with the loude minstralcye the heraudes that ful loude yolle and crye been in hir wele for ioye of daun arcite. but herkneth me and stinteth now a lyte which a miracle ther bifel anon.  this fierse arcite hath of his helm ydon and on a courser for to shewe his face he priketh endelong the large place  loking upward upon this emelye; and she agayn him caste a freendlich ye  for wommen as to speken in comune they folwen al the favour of fortune and she was al his chere as in his herte. out of the ground a furie infernal sterte from pluto sent at requeste of saturne  for which his hors for fere gan to turne and leep asyde and foundred as he leep; and er that arcite may taken keep  he pighte him on the pomel of his heed that in the place he lay as he were deed  his brest tobrosten with his sadelbowe. as blak he lay as any cole or crowe so was the blood yronnen in his face. anon he was yborn out of the place with herte soor to theseus paleys.  tho was he corven out of his harneys and in a bed ybrought ful faire and blyve for he was yet in memorie and alyve  and alway crying after emelye. duk theseus with al his companye  is comen hoom to athenes his citee with alle blisse and greet solempnitee. al be it that this aventure was falle he nolde noght disconforten hem alle. men seyde eek that arcite shal nat dye;  he shal ben heled of his maladye. and of another thing they were as fayn that of hem alle was ther noon yslayn  al were they sore yhurt and namely oon that with a spere was thirled his brestboon.  to othere woundes and to broken armes some hadden salves and some hadden charmes; fermacies of herbes and eek save they dronken for they wolde hir limes have. for which this noble duk as he wel can  conforteth and honoureth every man and made revel al the longe night unto the straunge lordes as was right.  ne ther was holden no disconfitinge but as a iustes or a tourneyinge;  for soothly ther was no disconfiture for falling nis nat but an aventure; ne to be lad with fors unto the stake unyolden and with twenty knightes take o persone allone withouten mo  and haried forth by arme foot and to and eek his stede driven forth with staves with footmen bothe yemen and eek knaves  it nas aretted him no vileinye ther may no man clepen it cowardye.  for which anon duk theseus leet crye to stinten alle rancour and envye the gree as wel of o syde as of other and either syde ylyk as otheres brother; and yaf hem yiftes after hir degree  and fully heeld a feste dayes three; and conveyed the kinges worthily out of his toun a iournee largely.  and hoom wente every man the righte way. ther was namore but far wel have good day!  of this bataille i wol namore endyte but speke of palamon and of arcite. swelleth the brest of arcite and the sore encreesseth at his herte more and more. the clothered blood for any lechecraft  corrupteth and is in his bouk ylaft that neither veyneblood ne ventusinge ne drinke of herbes may ben his helpinge.  the vertu expulsif or animal fro thilke vertu cleped natural  ne may the venim voyden ne expelle. the pypes of his longes gonne to swelle and every lacerte in his brest adoun is shent with venim and corrupcioun. him gayneth neither for to gete his lyf  vomyt upward ne dounward laxatif; al is tobrosten thilke regioun nature hath now no dominacioun.  and certeinly ther nature wol nat wirche farwel phisyk! go ber the man to chirche!  this al and som that arcita mot dye for which he sendeth after emelye and palamon that was his cosin dere; than seyde he thus as ye shul after here. naught may the woful spirit in myn herte  declare o poynt of alle my sorwes smerte to yow my lady that i love most; but i biquethe the service of my gost  to yow aboven every creature sin that my lyf may no lenger dure.  allas the wo! allas the peynes stronge that i for yow have suffred and so longe! allas the deeth! allas myn emelye! allas departing of our companye! allas myn hertes quene! allas my wyf!  myn hertes lady endere of my lyf! what is this world? what asketh men to have? now with his love now in his colde grave  allone withouten any companye. farwel my swete fo! myn emelye!  and softe tak me in your armes tweye for love of god and herkneth what i seye. i have heer with my cosin palamon had stryf and rancour many a day agon for love of yow and for my ielousye.  and iupiter so wis my soule gye to speken of a servant proprely with alle circumstaunces trewely  that is to seyn trouthe honour and knighthede wisdom humblesse estaat and heigh kinrede  fredom and al that longeth to that art so iupiter have of my soule part as in this world right now ne knowe i non so worthy to ben loved as palamon that serveth yow and wol don al his lyf.  and if that ever ye shul been a wyf foryet nat palamon the gentil man. and with that word his speche faille gan  for from his feet up to his brest was come the cold of deeth that hadde him overcome.  and yet moreover in his armes two the vital strengthe is lost and al ago. only the intellect withouten more that dwelled in his herte syk and sore gan faillen when the herte felte deeth  dusked his eyen two and failled breeth. but on his lady yet caste he his ye; his laste word was mercy emelye!  his spirit chaunged hous and wente ther as i cam never i can nat tellen wher.  therfor i stinte i nam no divinistre; of soules finde i nat in this registre ne me ne list thilke opiniouns to telle of hem though that they wryten wher they dwelle. arcite is cold ther mars his soule gye;  now wol i speken forth of emelye. shrighte emelye and howleth palamon and theseus his suster took anon  swowninge and bar hir fro the corps away. what helpeth it to tarien forth the day  to tellen how she weep bothe eve and morwe? for in swich cas wommen have swich sorwe whan that hir housbonds been from hem ago that for the more part they sorwen so or elles fallen in swich maladye  that at the laste certeinly they dye. infinite been the sorwes and the teres of olde folk and folk of tendre yeres  in al the toun for deeth of this theban; for him ther wepeth bothe child and man;  so greet a weping was ther noon certayn whan ector was ybroght al fresh yslayn to troye; allas! the pitee that was ther cracching of chekes rending eek of heer. why woldestow be deed thise wommen crye  and haddest gold ynough and emelye? no man mighte gladen theseus savinge his olde fader egeus  that knew this worldes transmutacioun as he had seyn it chaungen up and doun  ioye after wo and wo after gladnesse: and shewed hem ensamples and lyknesse. right as ther deyed never man quod he that he ne livede in erthe in som degree right so ther livede never man he seyde  in al this world that som tyme he ne deyde. this world nis but a thurghfare ful of wo and we ben pilgrimes passinge to and fro;  deeth is an ende of every worldly sore. and over al this yet seyde he muchel more  to this effect ful wysly to enhorte the peple that they sholde hem reconforte. duk theseus with al his bisy cure caste now wher that the sepulture of good arcite may best ymaked be  and eek most honurable in his degree. and at the laste he took conclusioun that ther as first arcite and palamoun  hadden for love the bataille hem bitwene that in that selve grove swote and grene  ther as he hadde his amorous desires his compleynt and for love his hote fires he wolde make a fyr in which thoffice funeral he mighte al accomplice; and leet comaunde anon to hakke and hewe  the okes olde and leye hem on a rewe in colpons wel arrayed for to brenne; his officers with swifte feet they renne  and ryde anon at his comaundement. and after this theseus hath ysent  after a bere and it al overspradde with cloth of gold the richest that he hadde. and of the same suyte he cladde arcite; upon his hondes hadde he gloves whyte; eek on his heed a croune of laurer grene  and in his hond a swerd ful bright and kene. he leyde him bare the visage on the bere therwith he weep that pitee was to here.  and for the peple sholde seen him alle whan it was day he broghte him to the halle  that roreth of the crying and the soun. tho cam this woful theban palamoun with flotery berd and ruggy asshy heres in clothes blake ydropped al with teres; and passing othere of weping emelye  the rewfulleste of al the companye. in as muche as the service sholde be the more noble and riche in his degree  duk theseus leet forth three stedes bringe that trapped were in steel al gliteringe  and covered with the armes of daun arcite. upon thise stedes that weren grete and whyte ther seten folk of which oon bar his sheeld another his spere up in his hondes heeld; the thridde bar with him his bowe turkeys  of brend gold was the cas and eek the harneys; and riden forth a pas with sorweful chere toward the grove as ye shul after here.  the nobleste of the grekes that ther were upon hir shuldres carieden the bere  with slakke pas and eyen rede and wete thurghout the citee by the maisterstrete that sprad was al with blak and wonder hye right of the same is al the strete ywrye. upon the right hond wente old egeus  and on that other syde duk theseus with vessels in hir hand of gold ful fyn al ful of hony milk and blood and wyn;  eek palamon with ful greet companye; and after that cam woful emelye  with fyr in honde as was that tyme the gyse to do thoffice of funeral servyse. heigh labour and ful greet apparaillinge was at the service and the fyrmakinge that with his grene top the heven raughte  and twenty fadme of brede the armes straughte; this is to seyn the bowes were so brode. of stree first ther was leyd ful many a lode.  but how the fyr was maked up on highte and eek the names how the trees highte  as ook firre birch asp alder holm popler wilow elm plane ash box chasteyn lind laurer mapul thorn beech hasel ew whippeltree how they weren feld shal nat be told for me; ne how the goddes ronnen up and doun  disherited of hir habitacioun in which they woneden in reste and pees nymphes faunes and amadrides;  ne how the bestes and the briddes alle fledden for fere whan the wode was falle;  ne how the ground agast was of the light that was nat wont to seen the sonne bright; ne how the fyr was couched first with stree and than with drye stokkes cloven a three and than with grene wode and spycerye  and than with cloth of gold and with perrye and gerlandes hanging with ful many a flour the mirre thencens with al so greet odour;  ne how arcite lay among al this ne what richesse aboute his body is;  ne how that emelye as was the gyse putte in the fyr of funeral servyse; ne how she swowned whan men made the fyr ne what she spak ne what was hir desyr; ne what ieweles men in the fyr tho caste  whan that the fyr was greet and brente faste; ne how som caste hir sheeld and som hir spere and of hir vestiments whiche that they were  and cuppes ful of wyn and milk and blood into the fyr that brente as it were wood;  ne how the grekes with an huge route thryes riden al the fyr aboute upon the left hand with a loud shoutinge and thryes with hir speres clateringe; and thryes how the ladies gonne crye;  ne how that lad was homward emelye; ne how arcite is brent to asshen colde; ne how that lichewake was yholde  al thilke night ne how the grekes pleye the wakepleyes ne kepe i nat to seye;  who wrastleth best naked with oille enoynt ne who that bar him best in no disioynt. i wol nat tellen eek how that they goon hoom til athenes whan the pley is doon; but shortly to the poynt than wol i wende  and maken of my longe tale an ende. by processe and by lengthe of certeyn yeres al stinted is the moorning and the teres  of grekes by oon general assent. than semed me ther was a parlement  at athenes upon certeyn poynts and cas; among the whiche poynts yspoken was to have with certeyn contrees alliaunce and have fully of thebans obeisaunce. for which this noble theseus anon  leet senden after gentil palamon unwist of him what was the cause and why; but in his blake clothes sorwefully  he cam at his comaundement in hye. tho sente theseus for emelye.  whan they were set and hust was al the place and theseus abiden hadde a space er any word cam from his wyse brest his eyen sette he ther as was his lest and with a sad visage he syked stille  and after that right thus he seyde his wille. the firste moevere of the cause above whan he first made the faire cheyne of love  greet was theffect and heigh was his entente; wel wiste he why and what therof he mente;  for with that faire cheyne of love he bond the fyr the eyr the water and the lond in certeyn boundes that they may nat flee; that same prince and that moevere quod he hath stablissed in this wrecched world adoun  certeyne dayes and duracioun to al that is engendred in this place over the whiche day they may nat pace  al mowe they yet tho dayes wel abregge; ther needeth non auctoritee allegge  for it is preved by experience but that me list declaren my sentence. than may men by this ordre wel discerne that thilke moevere stable is and eterne. wel may men knowe but it be a fool  that every part deryveth from his hool. for nature hath nat take his beginning of no partye ne cantel of a thing  but of a thing that parfit is and stable descending so til it be corrumpable.  and therfore of his wyse purveyaunce he hath so wel biset his ordinaunce that speces of thinges and progressiouns shullen enduren by successiouns and nat eterne be withoute lye:  this maistow understonde and seen at ye. lo the ook that hath so long a norisshinge from tyme that it first biginneth springe  and hath so long a lyf as we may see yet at the laste wasted is the tree.  considereth eek how that the harde stoon under our feet on which we trede and goon yit wasteth it as it lyth by the weye. the brode river somtyme wexeth dreye. the grete tounes see we wane and wende.  than may ye see that al this thing hath ende. of man and womman seen we wel also that nedeth in oon of thise termes two  this is to seyn in youthe or elles age he moot ben deed the king as shal a page;  som in his bed som in the depe see som in the large feeld as men may se; ther helpeth noght al goth that ilke weye. thanne may i seyn that al this thing moot deye. what maketh this but iupiter the king?  the which is prince and cause of alle thing converting al unto his propre welle from which it is deryved sooth to telle.  and hereagayns no creature on lyve of no degree availleth for to stryve.  thanne is it wisdom as it thinketh me to maken vertu of necessitee and take it wel that we may nat eschue and namely that to us alle is due. and whoso gruccheth ought he dooth folye  and rebel is to him that al may gye. and certeinly a man hath most honour to dyen in his excellence and flour  whan he is siker of his gode name; than hath he doon his freend ne him no shame.  and gladder oghte his freend ben of his deeth whan with honour upyolden is his breeth than whan his name apalled is for age; for al forgeten is his vasselage. than is it best as for a worthy fame  to dyen whan that he is best of name. the contrarie of al this is wilfulnesse. why grucchen we? why have we hevinesse  that good arcite of chivalrye flour departed is with duetee and honour  out of this foule prison of this lyf? why grucchen heer his cosin and his wyf of his welfare that loved hem so weel? can he hem thank? nay god wot never a deel that bothe his soule and eek hemself offende  and yet they mowe hir lustes nat amende. what may i conclude of this longe serie but after wo i rede us to be merie  and thanken iupiter of al his grace? and er that we departen from this place  i rede that we make of sorwes two o parfyt ioye lasting evermo; and loketh now wher most sorwe is herinne ther wol we first amenden and biginne. suster quod he this is my fulle assent  with al thavys heer of my parlement that gentil palamon your owne knight that serveth yow with wille herte and might  and ever hath doon sin that ye first him knewe that ye shul of your grace upon him rewe  and taken him for housbonde and for lord: leen me your hond for this is our acord. lat see now of your wommanly pitee. he is a kinges brother sone pardee; and though he were a povre bacheler  sin he hath served yow so many a yeer and had for yow so greet adversitee it moste been considered leveth me;  for gentil mercy oghte to passen right. than seyde he thus to palamon ful right;  i trowe ther nedeth litel sermoning to make yow assente to this thing. com neer and tak your lady by the hond. bitwixen hem was maad anon the bond that highte matrimoine or mariage  by al the counseil and the baronage. and thus with alle blisse and melodye hath palamon ywedded emelye.  and god that al this wyde world hath wroght sende him his love that hath it dere aboght.  for now is palamon in alle wele living in blisse in richesse and in hele; and emelye him loveth so tendrely and he hir serveth also gentilly that never was ther no word hem bitwene  of ielousye or any other tene. thus endeth palamon and emelye; and god save al this faire companye!amen.  here is ended the knightes tale. the millers prologue. here folwen the wordes bitwene the host and the millere. whan that the knight had thus his tale ytold in al the route nas ther yong ne old  that he ne seyde it was a noble storie and worthy for to drawen to memorie; and namely the gentils everichoon. our hoste lough and swoor so moot i goon this gooth aright; unbokeled is the male;  lat see now who shal telle another tale: for trewely the game is wel bigonne. now telleth ye sir monk if that ye conne  sumwhat to quyte with the knightes tale. the miller that fordronken was al pale  so that unnethe upon his hors he sat he nolde avalen neither hood ne hat ne abyde no man for his curteisye but in pilates vois he gan to crye and swoor by armes and by blood and bones  i can a noble tale for the nones with which i wol now quyte the knightes tale. our hoste saugh that he was dronke of ale  and seyde: abyd robin my leve brother som bettre man shal telle us first another:  abyd and lat us werken thriftily. by goddes soul quod he that wol nat i; for i wol speke or elles go my wey. our hoste answerde: tel on a devel wey! thou art a fool thy wit is overcome.  now herkneth quod the miller alle and some! but first i make a protestacioun that i am dronke i knowe it by my soun;  and therfore if that i misspeke or seye wyte it the ale of southwerk i yow preye;  for i wol telle a legende and a lyf bothe of a carpenter and of his wyf how that a clerk hath set the wrightes cappe. the reve answerde and seyde stint thy clappe lat be thy lewed dronken harlotrye.  it is a sinne and eek a greet folye to apeiren any man or him diffame and eek to bringen wyves in swich fame.  thou mayst ynogh of othere thinges seyn. this dronken miller spak ful sone ageyn  and seyde leve brother osewold who hath no wyf he is no cokewold. but i sey nat therfore that thou art oon; ther been ful gode wyves many oon  and ever a thousand gode ayeyns oon badde t. om. that knowestow wel thyself butif thou madde. t. om. why artow angry with my tale now? i have a wyf pardee as well as thou  yet nolde i for the oxen in my plogh taken upon me more than ynogh  as demen of myself that i were oon; i wol beleve wel that i am noon. an housbond shal nat been inquisitif of goddes privetee nor of his wyf. so he may finde goddes foyson there  of the remenant nedeth nat enquere. what sholde i more seyn but this millere he nolde his wordes for no man forbere  but tolde his cherles tale in his manere; me thinketh that i shal reherce it here.  and therfore every gentil wight i preye for goddes love demeth nat that i seye of evel entente but that i moot reherce hir tales alle be they bettre or werse or elles falsen som of my matere.  and therfore whoso list it nat yhere turne over the leef and chese another tale; for he shal finde ynowe grete and smale  of storial thing that toucheth gentillesse and eek moralitee and holinesse;  blameth nat me if that ye chese amis. the miller is a cherl ye knowe wel this; so was the reve and othere many mo and harlotrye they tolden bothe two. avyseth yow and putte me out of blame;  and eek men shal nat make ernest of game. here endeth the prologe. the milleres tale. here biginneth the millere his tale. whylom ther was dwellinge at oxenford a riche gnof that gestes heeld to bord and of his craft he was a carpenter. with him ther was dwellinge a povre scoler  had lerned art but al his fantasye was turned for to lerne astrologye and coude a certeyn of conclusiouns to demen by interrogaciouns if that men axed him in certein houres  whan that men sholde have droghte or elles shoures  or if men axed him what sholde bifalle of every thing i may nat rekene hem alle. this clerk was cleped hende nicholas; of derne love he coude and of solas;  and therto be was sleigh and ful privee and lyk a mayden meke for to see. a chambre hadde he in that hostelrye allone withouten any companye ful fetisly ydight with herbes swote;  and he himself as swete as is the rote  of licorys or any cetewale. his almageste and bokes grete and smale his astrelabie longinge for his art his augrimstones layen faire apart  on shelves couched at his beddes heed: his presse ycovered with a falding reed. and al above ther lay a gay sautrye on which he made a nightes melodye so swetely that al the chambre rong;  and angelus ad virginem he song;  and after that he song the kinges note; ful often blessed was his mery throte. and thus this swete clerk his tyme spente after his freendes finding and his rente.  this carpenter had wedded newe a wyf which that he lovede more than his lyf; of eightetene yeer she was of age. ialous he was and heeld hir narwe in cage for she was wilde and yong and he was old  and demed himself ben lyk a cokewold.  he knew nat catoun for his wit was rude that bad man sholde wedde his similitude. men sholde wedden after hir estaat for youthe and elde is often at debaat.  but sith that he was fallen in the snare he moste endure as other folk his care. fair was this yonge wyf and therwithal as any wesele hir body gent and smal. a ceynt she werede barred al of silk  a barmclooth eek as whyt as morne milk  upon hir lendes ful of many a gore. whyt was hir smok and brouded al bifore and eek bihinde on hir coler aboute of colblak silk withinne and eek withoute.  the tapes of hir whyte voluper were of the same suyte of hir coler; hir filet brood of silk and set ful hye: and sikerly she hadde a likerous ye. ful smale ypulled were hir browes two  and tho were bent and blake as any sloo.  she was ful more blisful on to see than is the newe pereionette tree; and softer than the wolle is of a wether. and by hir girdel heeng a purs of lether  tasseld with silk and perled with latoun. in al this world to seken up and doun there nis no man so wys that coude thenche so gay a popelote or swich a wenche. ful brighter was the shyning of hir hewe  than in the tour the noble yforged newe.  but of hir song it was as loude and yerne as any swalwe sittinge on a berne. therto she coude skippe and make game as any kide or calf folwinge his dame.  hir mouth was swete as bragot or the meeth or hord of apples leyd in hey or heeth. winsinge she was as is a ioly colt long as a mast and upright as a bolt. a brooch she baar upon hir lowe coler  as brood as is the bos of a bocler.  hir shoes were laced on hir legges hye; she was a prymerole a piggesnye for any lord to leggen in his bedde or yet for any good yeman to wedde.  now sire and eft sire so bifel the cas that on a day this hende nicholas fil with this yonge wyf to rage and pleye whyl that hir housbond was at oseneye as clerkes ben ful subtile and ful queynte;  and prively he caughte hir by the queynte  and seyde ywis but if ich have my wille for derne love of thee lemman i spille. and heeld hir harde by the haunchebones and seyde lemman love me al atones  or i wol dyen also god me save! and she sprong as a colt doth in the trave and with hir heed she wryed faste awey and seyde i wol nat kisse thee by my fey why lat be quod she lat be nicholas  or i wol crye out harrow and allas.  do wey your handes for your curteisye! this nicholas gan mercy for to crye and spak so faire and profred hir so faste that she hir love him graunted atte laste  and swoor hir ooth by seint thomas of kent that she wol been at his comandement whan that she may hir leyser wel espye. myn housbond is so ful of ialousye that but ye wayte wel and been privee  i woot right wel i nam but deed quod she.  ye moste been ful derne as in this cas. nay therof care thee noght quod nicholas a clerk had litherly biset his whyle butif he coude a carpenter bigyle.  and thus they been acorded and ysworn to wayte a tyme as i have told biforn. whan nicholas had doon thus everydeel and thakked hir aboute the lendes weel he kist hir swete and taketh his sautrye  and pleyeth faste and maketh melodye.  than fil it thus that to the parishchirche cristes owne werkes for to wirche this gode wyf wente on an haliday; hir forheed shoon as bright as any day  so was it wasshen whan she leet hir werk. now was ther of that chirche a parishclerk the which that was ycleped absolon. crul was his heer and as the gold it shoon and strouted as a fanne large and brode;  ful streight and even lay his ioly shode.  his rode was reed his eyen greye as goos; with powles window corven on his shoos in hoses rede he wente fetisly. yclad he was ful smal and proprely  al in a kirtel of a light wachet; ful faire and thikke been the poyntes set. and therupon he hadde a gay surplys as whyt as is the blosme upon the rys. a mery child he was so god me save  wel coude he laten blood and clippe and shave  and make a chartre of lond or acquitaunce. in twenty manere coude he trippe and daunce after the scole of oxenforde tho and with his legges casten to and fro  and pleyen songes on a small rubible; therto he song somtyme a loud quinible; and as wel coude he pleye on his giterne. in al the toun nas brewhous ne taverne that he ne visited with his solas  ther any gaylard tappestere was.  but sooth to seyn he was somdel squaymous of farting and of speche daungerous. this absolon that iolif was and gay gooth with a sencer on the haliday  sensinge the wyves of the parish faste; and many a lovely look on hem he caste and namely on this carpenteres wyf. to loke on hir him thoughte a mery lyf she was so propre and swete and likerous.  i dar wel seyn if she had been a mous  and he a cat he wolde hir hente anon. this parishclerk this ioly absolon hath in his herte swich a lovelonginge that of no wyf ne took he noon offringe;  for curteisye he seyde he wolde noon. the mone whan it was night ful brighte shoon and absolon his giterne hath ytake for paramours he thoghte for to wake. and forth he gooth iolif and amorous  til he cam to the carpenteres hous  a litel after cokkes hadde ycrowe; and dressed him up by a shotwindowe that was upon the carpenteres wal. he singeth in his vois gentil and smal  now dere lady if thy wille be i preye yow that ye wol rewe on me ful wel acordaunt to his giterninge. this carpenter awook and herde him singe and spak unto his wyf and seyde anon  what! alison! herestow nat absolon  that chaunteth thus under our boures wal? and she answerde hir housbond therwithal yis god wot iohn i here it everydel. this passeth forth; what wol ye bet than wel?  fro day to day this ioly absolon so woweth hir that him is wo bigon. he waketh al the night and al the day; he kempte hise lokkes brode and made him gay; he woweth hir by menes and brocage  and swoor he wolde been hir owne page;  he singeth brokkinge as a nightingale; he sente hir piment meeth and spyced ale and wafres pyping hote out of the glede; and for she was of toune he profred mede.  for som folk wol ben wonnen for richesse and som for strokes and som for gentillesse. somtyme to shewe his lightnesse and maistrye he pleyeth herodes on a scaffold hye. but what availleth him as in this cas?  she loveth so this hende nicholas  that absolon may blowe the bukkes horn; he ne hadde for his labour but a scorn; and thus she maketh absolon hir ape and al his ernest turneth til a iape.  ful sooth is this proverbe it is no lye men seyn right thus alwey the nye slye maketh the ferre leve to be looth. for though that absolon be wood or wrooth bycause that he fer was from hir sighte  this nye nicholas stood in his lighte.  now bere thee wel thou hende nicholas! for absolon may waille and singe allas. and so bifel it on a saterday this carpenter was goon til osenay;  and hende nicholas and alisoun acorded been to this conclusioun that nicholas shal shapen him a wyle this sely ialous housbond to bigyle; and if so be the game wente aright  she sholde slepen in his arm al night  for this was his desyr and hir also. and right anon withouten wordes mo this nicholas no lenger wolde tarie but doth ful softe unto his chambre carie  bothe mete and drinke for a day or tweye and to hir housbonde bad hir for to seye if that he axed after nicholas she sholde seye she niste where he was of al that day she saugh him nat with ye;  she trowed that he was in maladye  for for no cry hir mayde coude him calle; he nolde answere for nothing that mighte falle. this passeth forth al thilke saterday that nicholas stille in his chambre lay  and eet and sleep or dide what him leste til sonday that the sonne gooth to reste. this sely carpenter hath greet merveyle of nicholas or what thing mighte him eyle and seyde i am adrad by seint thomas  it stondeth nat aright with nicholas.  god shilde that he deyde sodeynly! this world is now ful tikel sikerly; i saugh today a cors yborn to chirche that now on monday last i saugh him wirche.  go up quod he unto his knave anoon clepe at his dore or knokke with a stoon loke how it is and tel me boldely. this knave gooth him up ful sturdily and at the chambredore whyl that he stood  he cryde and knokked as that he were wood:  what! how! what do ye maister nicholay? how may ye slepen al the longe day? but al for noght he herde nat a word; an hole he fond ful lowe upon a bord  ther as the cat was wont in for to crepe; and at that hole he looked in ful depe and at the laste he hadde of him a sighte. this nicholas sat gaping ever uprighte as he had kyked on the newe mone.  adoun he gooth and tolde his maister sone  in what array he saugh this ilke man. this carpenter to blessen him bigan and seyde help us seinte frideswyde! a man woot litel what him shal bityde.  this man is falle with his astromye in som woodnesse or in som agonye; i thoghte ay wel how that it sholde be! men sholde nat knowe of goddes privetee. ye blessed be alwey a lewed man  that noght but oonly his bileve can!  so ferde another clerk with astromye; he walked in the feeldes for to prye upon the sterres what ther sholde bifalle til he was in a marlepit yfalle;  he saugh nat that. but yet by seint thomas me reweth sore of hende nicholas. he shal be rated of his studying if that i may by iesus hevene king! get me a staf that i may underspore  whyl that thou robin hevest up the dore.  he shal out of his studying as i gesse and to the chambredore he gan him dresse. his knave was a strong carl for the nones and by the haspe he haf it up atones;  into the floor the dore fil anon. this nicholas sat ay as stille as stoon and ever gaped upward into the eir. this carpenter wende he were in despeir and hente him by the sholdres mightily  and shook him harde and cryde spitously  what! nicholay! what how! what! loke adoun! awake and thenk on cristes passioun; i crouche thee from elves and fro wightes! therwith the nightspel seyde he anonrightes  on foure halves of the hous aboute and on the threshfold of the dore withoute: iesu crist and seynt benedight blesse this hous from every wikked wight for nightes verye the white paternoster!  where wentestow seynt petres soster?  and atte laste this hende nicholas gan for to syke sore and seyde allas! shal al the world be lost eftsones now? this carpenter answerde what seystow?  what! thenk on god as we don men that swinke. this nicholas answerde fecche me drinke; and after wol i speke in privetee of certeyn thing that toucheth me and thee; i wol telle it non other man certeyn.  this carpenter goth doun and comth ageyn  and broghte of mighty ale a large quart; and whan that ech of hem had dronke his part this nicholas his dore faste shette and doun the carpenter by him he sette.  he seyde iohn myn hoste lief and dere thou shall upon thy trouthe swere me here that to no wight thou shalt this conseil wreye; for it is cristes conseil that i seye and if thou telle it man thou are forlore;  for this vengaunce thou shalt han therfore  that if thou wreye me thou shalt be wood! nay crist forbede it for his holy blood! quod tho this sely man i nam no labbe ne though i seye i nam nat lief to gabbe.  sey what thou wolt i shal it never telle to child ne wyf by him that harwed helle! now john quod nicholas i wol nat lye; i have yfounde in myn astrologye as i have loked in the mone bright  that now a monday next at quarternight  shal falle a reyn and that so wilde and wood that half so greet was never noes flood. this world he seyde in lasse than in an hour shal al be dreynt so hidous is the shour;  thus shal mankynde drenche and lese hir lyf. this carpenter answerde allas my wyf! and shal she drenche? allas! myn alisoun! for sorwe of this he fil almost adoun and seyde is ther no remedie in this cas?  why yis for gode quod hende nicholas  if thou wolt werken after lore and reed; thou mayst nat werken after thyn owene heed. for thus seith salomon that was ful trewe werk al by conseil and thou shalt nat rewe.  and if thou werken wolt by good conseil i undertake withouten mast and seyl yet shal i saven hir and thee and me hastow nat herd how saved was noe whan that our lord had warned him biforn  that al the world with water sholde be lorn?  yis quod this carpenter ful yore ago. hastow nat herd quod nicholas also the sorwe of noe with his felawshipe er that he mighte gete his wyf to shipe?  him had be lever i dar wel undertake at thilke tyme than alle hise wetheres blake that she hadde had a ship hirself allone. and therfore wostou what is best to done? this asketh haste and of an hastif thing  men may nat preche or maken tarying.  anon go gete us faste into this in a knedingtrogh or elles a kimelin for ech of us but loke that they be large in whiche we mowe swimme as in a barge  and han therinne vitaille suffisant but for a day; fy on the remenant! the water shal aslake and goon away aboute pryme upon the nexte day. but robin may nat wite of this thy knave  ne eek thy mayde gille i may nat save;  axe nat why for though thou aske me i wol nat tellen goddes privetee. suffiseth thee but if thy wittes madde to han as greet a grace as noe hadde.  thy wyf shal i wel saven out of doute go now thy wey and speed thee heeraboute. but whan thou hast for hir and thee and me ygeten us thise knedingtubbes three than shaltow hange hem in the roof ful hye  that no man of our purveyaunce spye.  and whan thou thus hast doon as i have seyd and hast our vitaille faire in hem yleyd and eek an ax to smyte the corde atwo when that the water comth that we may go  and broke an hole an heigh upon the gable unto the gardinward over the stable that we may frely passen forth our way whan that the grete shour is goon away than shaltow swimme as myrie i undertake  as doth the whyte doke after hir drake.  than wol i clepe how! alison! how! john! be myrie for the flood wol passe anon. and thou wolt seyn hayl maister nicholay! good morwe i se thee wel for it is day.  and than shul we be lordes al our lyf of al the world as noe and his wyf. but of o thyng i warne thee ful right be wel avysed on that ilke night that we ben entred into shippes bord  that noon of us ne speke nat a word  ne clepe ne crye but been in his preyere; for it is goddes owne heste dere. thy wyf and thou mote hange fer atwinne for that bitwixe yow shal be no sinne  no more in looking than ther shal in dede; this ordinance is seyd go god thee spede! tomorwe at night whan men ben alle aslepe into our knedingtubbes wol we crepe and sitten ther abyding goddes grace.  go now thy wey i have no lenger space  to make of this no lenger sermoning. men seyn thus send the wyse and sey nothing; thou art so wys it nedeth thee nat teche; go save our lyf and that i thee biseche.  this sely carpenter goth forth his wey. ful ofte he seith allas and weylawey and to his wyf he tolde his privetee; and she was war and knew it bet than he what al this queynte cast was for to seye.  but nathelees she ferde as she wolde deye  and seyde allas! go forth thy wey anon help us to scape or we ben lost echon; i am thy trewe verray wedded wyf; go dere spouse and help to save our lyf.  lo! which a greet thyng is affeccioun! men may dye of imaginacioun so depe may impressioun be take. this sely carpenter biginneth quake; him thinketh verraily that he may see  noes flood come walwing as the see  to drenchen alisoun his hony dere. he wepeth weyleth maketh sory chere he syketh with ful many a sory swogh. he gooth and geteth him a knedingtrogh  and after that a tubbe and a kimelin and prively he sente hem to his in and heng hem in the roof in privetee. his owne hand he made laddres three to climben by the ronges and the stalkes  unto the tubbes hanginge in the balkes  and hem vitailled bothe trogh and tubbe with breed and chese and good ale in a iubbe suffysinge right ynogh as for a day. but er that he had maad al this array  he sente his knave and eek his wenche also upon his nede to london for to go. and on the monday whan it drow to night he shette his dore withoute candellight and dressed al thing as it sholde be.  and shortly up they clomben alle three;  they sitten stille wel a furlongway. now paternoster clom! seyde nicholay and clom quod john and clom seyde alisoun. this carpenter seyde his devocioun  and stille he sit and biddeth his preyere awaytinge on the reyn if he it here. the dede sleep for wery bisinesse fil on this carpenter right as i gesse aboute corfewtyme or litel more;  for travail of his goost he groneth sore  and eft he routeth for his heed mislay. doun of the laddre stalketh nicholay and alisoun ful softe adoun she spedde; withouten wordes mo they goon to bedde  theras the carpenter is wont to lye. ther was the revel and the melodye; and thus lyth alison and nicholas in bisinesse of mirthe and of solas til that the belle of laudes gan to ringe  and freres in the chauncel gonne singe.  this parishclerk this amorous absolon that is for love alwey so wo bigon upon the monday was at oseneye with companye him to disporte and pleye  and axed upon cas a cloisterer ful prively after iohn the carpenter; and he drough him apart out of the chirche and seyde i noot i saugh him here nat wirche sin saterday; i trow that he be went  for timber ther our abbot hath him sent;  for he is wont for timber for to go and dwellen at the grange a day or two; or elles he is at his hous certeyn; wher that he be i can nat sothly seyn.  this absolon ful ioly was and light and thoghte now is tyme wake al night; for sikirly i saugh him nat stiringe aboute his dore sin day bigan to springe. so moot i thryve i shal at cokkes crowe  ful prively knokken at his windowe  that stant ful lowe upon his boures wal. to alison now wol i tellen al my lovelonging for yet i shal nat misse that at the leste wey i shal hir kisse.  som maner confort shal i have parfay my mouth hath icched al this longe day; that is a signe of kissing atte leste. al night me mette eek i was at a feste. therfor i wol gon slepe an houre or tweye  and al the night than wol i wake and pleye.  whan that the firste cok hath crowe anon up rist this ioly lover absolon and him arrayeth gay at pointdevys. but first he cheweth greyn and lycorys  to smellen swete er he had kembd his heer. under his tonge a trewe love he beer for therby wende he to ben gracious. he rometh to the carpenteres hous and stille he stant under the shotwindowe;  unto his brest it raughte it was so lowe;  and softe he cogheth with a semisoun what do ye honycomb swete alisoun? my faire brid my swete cinamome awaketh lemman myn and speketh to me!  wel litel thenken ye upon my wo that for your love i swete ther i go. no wonder is thogh that i swelte and swete; i moorne as doth a lamb after the tete. ywis lemman i have swich lovelonginge  that lyk a turtel trewe is my moorninge;  i may nat ete na more than a mayde. go fro the window iakke fool she sayde as help me god it wol nat be com ba me i love another and elles i were to blame  wel bet than thee by iesu absolon! go forth thy wey or i wol caste a ston and lat me slepe a twenty devel wey! allas quod absolon and weylawey! that trewe love was ever so yvel biset!  than kisse me sin it may be no bet  for iesus love and for the love of me. wiltow than go thy wey therwith? quod she. ye certes lemman quod this absolon. thanne make thee redy quod she i come anon;  and unto nicholas she seyde stille t. om. now hust and thou shall laughen al thy fille. t. om. this absolon doun sette him on his knees and seyde i am a lord at alle degrees; for after this i hope ther cometh more!  lemman thy grace and swete brid thyn ore!  the window she undoth and that in haste have do quod she com of and speed thee faste lest that our neighebores thee espye. this absolon gan wype his mouth ful drye;  derk was the night as pich or as the cole and at the window out she putte hir hole and absolon him fil no bet ne wers but with his mouth he kiste hir naked ers ful savourly er he was war of this.  abak he sterte and thoghte it was amis  for wel he wiste a womman hath no berd; he felte a thing al rough and long yherd and seyde fy! allas! what have i do? tehee! quod she and clapte the window to;  and absolon goth forth a sory pas. a berd a berd! quod hende nicholas by goddes corpus this goth faire and weel! this sely absolon herde every deel and on his lippe he gan for anger byte;  and to himself he seyde i shal thee quyte!  who rubbeth now who froteth now his lippes with dust with sond with straw with clooth with chippes but absolon that seith ful ofte allas! my soule bitake i unto sathanas  but me wer lever than al this toun quod he of this despyt awroken for to be! allas! quod he allas! i ne hadde ybleynt! his hote love was cold and al yqueynt; for fro that tyme that he had kiste hir ers  of paramours he sette nat a kers  for he was heled of his maladye; ful ofte paramours he gan deffye and weep as dooth a child that is ybete. a softe paas he wente over the strete  until a smith men cleped daun gerveys that in his forge smithed ploughharneys; he sharpeth shaar and culter bisily. this absolon knokketh al esily and seyde undo gerveys and that anon.  what who artow? it am i absolon.  what absolon! for cristes swete tree why ryse ye so rathe ey benedicite! what eyleth yow? som gay gerl god it woot hath broght yow thus upon the viritoot;  by seynt note ye woot wel what i mene. this absolon ne roghte nat a bene of al his pley no word agayn he yaf; he hadde more tow on his distaf than gerveys knew and seyde freend so dere  that hote culter in the chimenee here  as lene it me i have therwith to done and i wol bringe it thee agayn ful sone. gerveys answerde certes were it gold or in a poke nobles alle untold  thou sholdest have as i am trewe smith; ey cristes foo! what wol ye do therwith? therof quod absolon be as be may; i shal wel telle it thee tomorwe day and caughte the culter by the colde stele.  ful softe out at the dore he gan to stele  and wente unto the carpenteres wal. he cogheth first and knokketh therwithal upon the windowe right as he dide er. this alison answerde who is ther  that knokketh so? i warante it a theef. why nay quod he god woot my swete leef i am thyn absolon my dereling! of gold quod he i have thee broght a ring; my moder yaf it me so god me save  ful fyn it is and therto wel ygrave;  this wol i yeve thee if thou me kisse! this nicholas was risen for to pisse and thoghte he wolde amenden al the iape he sholde kisse his ers er that he scape.  and up the windowe dide he hastily and out his ers he putteth prively over the buttok to the haunchebon; and therwith spak this clerk this absolon spek swete brid i noot nat wher thou art.  this nicholas anon leet flee a fart  as greet as it had been a thonderdent that with the strook he was almost yblent; and he was redy with his iren hoot and nicholas amidde the ers he smoot.  of gooth the skin an handebrede aboute the hole culter brende so his toute and for the smert he wende for to dye. as he were wood for wo he gan to crye help! water! water! help for goddes herte!  this carpenter out of his slomber sterte  and herde oon cryen water as he were wood and thoghte allas! now comth nowelis flood! he sit him up withouten wordes mo and with his ax he smoot the corde atwo  and doun goth al; he fond neither to selle ne breed ne ale til he cam to the selle upon the floor; and ther aswowne he lay. up sterte hir alison and nicholay and cryden out and harrow in the strete.  the neighebores bothe smale and grete  in ronnen for to gauren on this man that yet aswowne he lay bothe pale and wan; for with the fal he brosten hadde his arm; but stonde he moste unto his owne harm.  for whan he spak he was anon bore doun with hende nicholas and alisoun. they tolden every man that he was wood he was agast so of nowelis flood thurgh fantasye that of his vanitee  he hadde yboght him knedingtubbes three  and hadde hem hanged in the roof above; and that he preyed hem for goddes love to sitten in the roof par companye. the folk gan laughen at his fantasye;  into the roof they kyken and they gape and turned al his harm unto a iape. for what so that this carpenter answerde it was for noght no man his reson herde; with othes grete he was so sworn adoun  that he was holden wood in al the toun;  for every clerk anonright heeld with other. they seyde the man is wood my leve brother; and every wight gan laughen of this stryf. thus swyved was the carpenteres wyf  for al his keping and his ialousye; and absolon hath kist hir nether ye; and nicholas is scalded in the toute.  this tale is doon and god save al the route!  here endeth the millere his tale. the reeves prologue the prologe of the reves tale. whan folk had laughen at this nyce cas  of absolon and hende nicholas diverse folk diversely they seyde; but for the more part they loughe and pleyde ne at this tale i saugh no man him greve but it were only osewold the reve  bycause he was of carpenteres craft. a litel ire is in his herte ylaft he gan to grucche and blamed it a lyte. so theek quod he ful wel coude i yow quyte  with blering of a proud milleres ye  if that me liste speke of ribaudye. but ik am old me list not pley for age; grastyme is doon my fodder is now forage this whyte top wryteth myne olde yeres myn herte is also mowled as myne heres  butif i fare as dooth an openers; that ilke fruit is ever leng the wers til it be roten in mullok or in stree. we olde men i drede so fare we;  til we be roten can we nat be rype;  we hoppen ay whyl that the world wol pype. for in oure wil ther stiketh ever a nayl to have an hoor heed and a grene tayl as hath a leek; for thogh our might be goon our wil desireth folie ever in oon.  for whan we may nat doon than wol we speke; yet in our asshen olde is fyr yreke. foure gledes han we whiche i shal devyse avaunting lying anger coveityse;  thise foure sparkles longen unto elde.  our olde lemes mowe wel been unwelde but wil ne shal nat faillen that is sooth. and yet ik have alwey a coltes tooth as many a yeer as it is passed henne sin that my tappe of lyf bigan to renne.  for sikerly whan i was bore anon deeth drogh the tappe of lyf and leet it gon; and ever sith hath so the tappe yronne til that almost al empty is the tonne.  the streem of lyf now droppeth on the chimbe;  the sely tonge may wel ringe and chimbe of wrecchednesse that passed is ful yore; with olde folk save dotage is namore. whan that our host hadde herd this sermoning he gan to speke as lordly as a king;  he seide what amounteth al this wit? what shul we speke alday of holy writ? the devel made a reve for to preche and of a souter a shipman or a leche.  sey forth thy tale and tarie nat the tyme  lo depeford! and it is halfway pryme. lo grenewich ther many a shrewe is inne; it were al tyme thy tale to biginne. now sires quod this osewold the reve i pray yow alle that ye nat yow greve  thogh i answere and somdel sette his howve; for leveful is with force force ofshowve. this dronke millere hath ytold us heer how that bigyled was a carpenteer  peraventure in scorn for i am oon.  and by your leve i shal him quyte anoon; right in his cherles termes wol i speke. i pray to god his nekke mote breke; he can wel in myn ye seen a stalke but in his owne he can nat seen a balke.  the reves tale. here biginneth the reves tale. at trumpington nat fer fro cantebrigge ther goth a brook and over that a brigge upon the whiche brook ther stant a melle; and this is verray soth that i yow telle. a miller was ther dwelling many a day;  as eny pecok he was proud and gay. pypen he coude and fisshe and nettes bete and turne coppes and wel wrastle and shete; and by his belt he baar a long panade and of a swerd ful trenchant was the blade.  a ioly popper baar he in his pouche;  ther was no man for peril dorste him touche. a sheffeld thwitel baar he in his hose; round was his face and camuse was his nose. as piled as an ape was his skulle.  he was a marketbeter atte fulle. ther dorste no wight hand upon him legge that he ne swoor he sholde anon abegge. a theef he was for sothe of corn and mele and that a sly and usaunt for to stele.  his name was hoten deynous simkin.  a wyf he hadde ycomen of noble kin; the person of the toun hir fader was. with hir he yaf ful many a panne of bras for that simkin sholde in his blood allye.  she was yfostred in a nonnerye; for simkin wolde no wyf as he sayde but she were wel ynorissed and a mayde to saven his estaat of yomanrye. and she was proud and pert as is a pye.  a ful fair sighte was it on hem two;  on halydayes biforn hir wolde he go with his tipet bounden about his heed and she cam after in a gyte of reed; and simkin hadde hosen of the same.  ther dorste no wight clepen hir but dame. was noon so hardy that wente by the weye that with hir dorste rage or ones pleye butif he wolde be slayn of simkin with panade or with knyf or boydekin.  for ialous folk ben perilous evermo  algate they wolde hir wyves wenden so. and eek for she was somdel smoterlich she was as digne as water in a dich; and ful of hoker and of bisemare.  hir thoughte that a lady sholde hir spare what for hir kinrede and hir nortelrye that she had lerned in the nonnerye. a doghter hadde they bitwixe hem two of twenty yeer withouten any mo  savinge a child that was of halfyeer age;  in cradel it lay and was a propre page. this wenche thikke and wel ygrowen was with camuse nose and yen greye as glas; with buttokes brode and brestes rounde and hye  but right fair was hir heer i wol nat lye. the person of the toun for she was feir in purpos was to maken hir his heir bothe of his catel and his messuage and straunge he made it of hir mariage.  his purpos was for to bistowe hir hye  into som worthy blood of auncetrye; for holy chirches good moot been despended on holy chirches blood that is descended. therfore he wolde his holy blood honoure  though that he holy chirche sholde devoure. gret soken hath this miller out of doute with whete and malt of al the land aboute; and nameliche ther was a greet collegge men clepen the solerhalle at cantebregge  ther was hir whete and eek hir malt ygrounde.  and on a day it happed in a stounde sik lay the maunciple on a maladye; men wenden wisly that he sholde dye. for which this miller stal bothe mele and corn  an hundred tyme more than biforn; for therbiforn he stal but curteisly but now he was a theef outrageously for which the wardeyn chidde and made fare. but therof sette the miller nat a tare;  he craketh boost and swoor it was nat so.  than were ther yonge povre clerkes two that dwelten in this halle of which i seye. testif they were and lusty for to pleye and only for hir mirthe and revelrye  upon the wardeyn bisily they crye to yeve hem leve but a litel stounde to goon to mille and seen hir corn ygrounde; and hardily they dorste leye hir nekke the miller shold nat stele hem half a pekke  of corn by sleighte ne by force hem reve;  and at the laste the wardeyn yaf hem leve. iohn hight that oon and aleyn hight that other; of o toun were they born that highte strother fer in the north i can nat telle where.  this aleyn maketh redy al his gere and on an hors the sak he caste anon. forth goth aleyn the clerk and also iohn with good swerd and with bokeler by hir syde. iohn knew the wey hem nedede no gyde  and at the mille the sak adoun he layth.  aleyn spak first al hayl symond yfayth; how fares thy faire doghter and thy wyf? aleyn! welcome quod simkin by my lyf and iohn also how now what do ye heer?  symond quod iohn by god nede has na peer; him boes serve himselve that has na swayn or elles he is a fool as clerkes sayn. our manciple i hope he wil be deed swa werkes ay the wanges in his heed.  and forthy is i come and eek alayn  to grinde our corn and carie it ham agayn; i pray yow spede us hethen that ye may. it shal be doon quod simkin by my fay; what wol ye doon whyl that it is in hande?  by god right by the hoper wil i stande quod iohn and se how that the corn gas in; yet saugh i never by my fader kin how that the hoper wagges til and fra. aleyn answerde iohn and wiltow swa  than wil i be bynethe by my croun  and se how that the mele falles doun into the trough; that sal be my disport. for iohn in faith i may been of your sort; i is as ille a miller as are ye.  this miller smyled of hir nycetee and thoghte al this nis doon but for a wyle; they wene that no man may hem bigyle; but by my thrift yet shal i blere hir ye for al the sleighte in hir philosophye.  the more queynte crekes that they make  the more wol i stele whan i take. in stede of flour yet wol i yeve hem bren. the gretteste clerkes been noght the wysest men as whylom to the wolf thus spak the mare;  of al hir art i counte noght a tare. out at the dore he gooth ful prively whan that he saugh his tyme softely; he loketh up and doun til he hath founde the clerkes hors ther as it stood ybounde  bihinde the mille under a levesel;  and to the hors he gooth him faire and wel; he strepeth of the brydel right anon. and whan the hors was loos he ginneth gon toward the fen ther wilde mares renne  forth with wehee thurgh thikke and thurgh thenne. this miller gooth agayn no word he seyde but dooth his note and with the clerkes pleyde til that hir corn was faire and wel ygrounde. and whan the mele is sakked and ybounde  this iohn goth out and fynt his hors away  and gan to crye harrow and weylaway! our hors is lorn! alayn for goddes banes step on thy feet com out man al at anes! allas our wardeyn has his palfrey lorn.  this aleyn al forgat bothe mele and corn al was out of his mynde his housbondrye. what? whilk way is he geen? he gan to crye. the wyf cam leping inward with a ren she seyde allas! your hors goth to the fen  with wilde mares as faste as he may go.  unthank come on his hand that bond him so and he that bettre sholde han knit the reyne. allas quod iohn aleyn for cristes peyne lay doun thy swerd and i wil myn alswa;  i is ful wight god waat as is a raa; by goddes herte he sal nat scape us bathe. why nadstow pit the capul in the lathe? ilhayl by god aleyn thou is a fonne! this sely clerkes han ful faste yronne  toward the fen bothe aleyn and eek iohn.  and whan the miller saugh that they were gon he half a busshel of hir flour hath take and bad his wyf go knede it in a cake. he seyde i trowe the clerkes were aferd;  yet can a miller make a clerkes berd for al his art; now lat hem goon hir weye. lo wher they goon ye lat the children pleye; they gete him nat so lightly by my croun! thise sely clerkes rennen up and doun  with keep keep stand stand iossa warderere  ga whistle thou and i shal kepe him here! but shortly til that it was verray night they coude nat though they do al hir might hir capul cacche he ran alwey so faste  til in a dich they caughte him atte laste. wery and weet as beste is in the reyn comth sely iohn and with him comth aleyn. allas quod iohn the day that i was born! now are we drive til hething and til scorn.  our corn is stole men wil us foles calle  bathe the wardeyn and our felawes alle and namely the miller; weylaway! thus pleyneth iohn as he goth by the way toward the mille and bayard in his hond.  the miller sitting by the fyr he fond for it was night and forther mighte they noght; but for the love of god they him bisoght of herberwe and of ese as for hir peny. the miller seyde agayn if ther be eny  swich as it is yet shal ye have your part.  myn hous is streit but ye han lerned art; ye conne by argumentes make a place a myle brood of twenty foot of space. lat see now if this place may suffyse  or make it roum with speche as is youre gyse. now symond seyde iohn by seint cutberd ay is thou mery and this is faire answerd. i have herd seyd man sal taa of twa thinges slyk as he fyndes or taa slyk as he bringes.  but specially i pray thee hoste dere  get us som mete and drinke and make us chere and we wil payen trewely atte fulle. with empty hand men may na haukes tulle; lo here our silver redy for to spende.  this miller into toun his doghter sende for ale and breed and rosted hem a goos and bond hir hors it sholde nat gon loos; and in his owne chambre hem made a bed with shetes and with chalons faire yspred  noght from his owne bed ten foot or twelve.  his doghter hadde a bed al by hirselve right in the same chambre by and by; it mighte be no bet and cause why ther was no roumer herberwe in the place.  they soupen and they speke hem to solace and drinken ever strong ale atte beste. aboute midnight wente they to reste. wel hath this miller vernisshed his heed; ful pale he was fordronken and nat reed.  he yexeth and he speketh thurgh the nose  as he were on the quakke or on the pose. to bedde he gooth and with him goth his wyf. as any iay she light was and iolyf so was hir ioly whistle wel ywet.  the cradel at hir beddes feet is set to rokken and to yeve the child to souke. and whan that dronken al was in the crouke to bedde went the doghter right anon; to bedde gooth aleyn and also iohn;  ther nas na more hem nedede no dwale.  this miller hath so wisly bibbed ale that as an hors he snorteth in his sleep ne of his tayl bihinde he took no keep. his wyf bar him a burdon a ful strong  men mighte hir routing here two furlong; the wenche routeth eek par companye. aleyn the clerk that herd this melodye he poked iohn and seyde slepestow? herdestow ever slyk a sang er now?  lo whilk a compline is ymel hem alle!  a wilde fyr upon thair bodyes falle! wha herkned ever slyk a ferly thing? ye they sal have the flour of il ending. this lange night ther tydes me na reste;  but yet na fors; al sal be for the beste. for iohn seyde he als ever moot i thryve if that i may yon wenche wil i swyve. som esement has lawe yshapen us; for iohn ther is a lawe that says thus  that gif a man in a point be ygreved  that in another he sal be releved. our corn is stoln shortly it is na nay and we han had an il fit al this day. and sin i sal have neen amendement  agayn my los i wil have esement. by goddes saule it sal neen other be! this iohn answerde alayn avyse thee the miller is a perilous man he seyde and gif that he out of his sleep abreyde  he mighte doon us bathe a vileinye.  aleyn answerde i count him nat a flye; and up he rist and by the wenche he crepte. this wenche lay upright and faste slepte til he so ny was er she mighte espye  that it had been to late for to crye and shortly for to seyn they were at on; now pley aleyn! for i wol speke of iohn. this iohn lyth stille a furlongwey or two and to himself he maketh routhe and wo:  allas! quod he this is a wikked iape;  now may i seyn that i is but an ape. yet has my felawe somwhat for his harm; he has the milleris doghter in his arm. he auntred him and has his nedes sped  and i lye as a drafsek in my bed; and when this iape is tald another day i sal been halde a daf a cokenay! i wil aryse and auntre it by my fayth! unhardy is unsely thus men sayth.  and up he roos and softely he wente  unto the cradel and in his hand it hente and baar it softe unto his beddes feet. sone after this the wyf hir routing leet and gan awake and wente hir out to pisse  and cam agayn and gan hir cradel misse and groped heer and ther but she fond noon. allas! quod she i hadde almost misgoon; i hadde almost gon to the clerkes bed. by benedicite! thanne hadde i foule ysped:  and forth she gooth til she the cradel fond.  she gropeth alwey forther with hir hond and fond the bed and thoghte noght but good bycause that the cradel by it stood and niste wher she was for it was derk;  but faire and wel she creep in to the clerk and lyth ful stille and wolde han caught a sleep. withinne a whyl this iohn the clerk up leep and on this gode wyf he leyth on sore. so mery a fit ne hadde she nat ful yore;  he priketh harde and depe as he were mad.  this ioly lyf han thise two clerkes lad til that the thridde cok bigan to singe. aleyn wex wery in the daweninge for he had swonken al the longe night;  and seyde far wel malin swete wight! the day is come i may no lenger byde; but evermo wher so i go or ryde i is thyn awen clerk swa have i seel! now dere lemman quod she go far weel!  but er thou go o thing i wol thee telle  whan that thou wendest homward by the melle right at the entree of the dore bihinde thou shalt a cake of half a busshel finde that was ymaked of thyn owne mele  which that i heelp my fader for to stele. and gode lemman god thee save and kepe! and with that word almost she gan to wepe. aleyn uprist and thoughte er that it dawe i wol go crepen in by my felawe;  and fond the cradel with his hand anon  by god thoghte he al wrang i have misgon; myn heed is toty of my swink tonight that maketh me that i go nat aright. i woot wel by the cradel i have misgo  heer lyth the miller and his wyf also. and forth he goth a twenty devel way unto the bed theras the miller lay. he wende have cropen by his felawe iohn; and by the miller in he creep anon  and caughte hym by the nekke and softe he spak:  he seyde thou iohn thou swynesheed awak for cristes saule and heer a noble game. for by that lord that called is seint iame as i have thryes in this shorte night  swyved the milleres doghter boltupright whyl thow hast as a coward been agast. ye false harlot quod the miller hast? a! false traitour! false clerk! quod he thou shalt be deed by goddes dignitee!  who dorste be so bold to disparage  my doghter that is come of swich linage? and by the throtebolle he caughte alayn. and he hente hym despitously agayn and on the nose he smoot him with his fest.  doun ran the blody streem upon his brest; and in the floor with nose and mouth tobroke they walwe as doon two pigges in a poke. and up they goon and doun agayn anon til that the miller sporned at a stoon  and doun he fil bakward upon his wyf  that wiste nothing of this nyce stryf; for she was falle aslepe a lyte wight with iohn the clerk that waked hadde al night. and with the fal out of hir sleep she breyde  help holy croys of bromeholm she seyde in manus tuas! lord to thee i calle! awak symond! the feend is on us falle myn herte is broken help i nam but deed; there lyth oon up my wombe and up myn heed;  help simkin for the false clerkes fighte.  this iohn sterte up as faste as ever he mighte and graspeth by the walles to and fro to finde a staf; and she sterte up also and knew the estres bet than dide this iohn  and by the wal a staf she fond anon and saugh a litel shimering of a light for at an hole in shoon the mone bright; and by that light she saugh hem bothe two but sikerly she niste who was who  but as she saugh a whyt thing in hir ye. l and whan she gan the whyte thing espye she wende the clerk hadde wered a volupeer. and with the staf she drough ay neer and neer and wende han hit this aleyn at the fulle  and smoot the miller on the pyled skulle that doun he gooth and cryde harrow! i dye! thise clerkes bete him weel and lete him lye; and greythen hem and toke hir hors anon and eek hir mele and on hir wey they gon.  and at the mille yet they toke hir cake  of half a busshel flour ful wel ybake. thus is the proude miller wel ybete and hath ylost the grinding of the whete and payed for the soper everydeel  of aleyn and of iohn that bette him weel. his wyf is swyved and his doghter als; lo swich it is a miller to be fals! and therfore this proverbe is seyd ful sooth him thar nat wene wel that yvel dooth;  a gylour shal himself bigyled be.  and god that sitteth heighe in magestee save al this companye grete and smale! thus have i quit the miller in my tale. here is ended the reves tale. the cooks prologue. the prologe of the cokes tale. the cook of london whyl the reve spak  for ioye him thoughte he clawed him on the bak ha! ha! quod he for cristes passioun this miller hadde a sharp conclusioun upon his argument of herbergage! wel seyde salomon in his langage  ne bringe nat every man into thyn hous; for herberwing by nighte is perilous. wel oghte a man avysed for to be whom that he broghte into his privetee.  i pray to god so yeve me sorwe and care  if ever sith i highte hogge of ware herde i a miller bettre yset awerk. he hadde a iape of malice in the derk. but god forbede that we stinten here; and therfore if ye vouchesauf to here  a tale of me that am a povre man i wol yow telle as wel as ever i can a litel iape that fil in our citee. our host answerde and seide i graunte it thee;  now telle on roger loke that it be good;  for many a pastee hastow laten blood and many a iakke of dover hastow sold that hath been twyes hoot and twyes cold. of many a pilgrim hastow cristes curs for of thy persly yet they fare the wors  that they han eten with thy stubbelgoos;

and therfore herry bailly by thy feith be thou nat wrooth er we departen heer though that my tale be of an hostileer.  but nathelees i wol nat telle it yit but er we parte ywis thou shalt be quit. and therwithal he lough and made chere and seyde his tale as ye shul after here.  thus endeth the prologe of the cokes tale. the cokes tale. heer bigynneth the cokes tale. a prentis whylom dwelled in our citee  and of a craft of vitaillers was he; gaillard he was as goldfinch in the shawe broun as a berie a propre short felawe with lokkes blake ykempt ful fetisly. dauncen he coude so wel and iolily  that he was cleped perkin revelour. he was as ful of love and paramour as is the hyve ful of hony swete; wel was the wenche with him mighte mete.  at every brydale wolde he singe and hoppe  he loved bet the taverne than the shoppe. for whan ther any ryding was in chepe out of the shoppe thider wolde he lepe. til that he hadde al the sighte yseyn and daunced wel he wolde nat come ageyn.  and gadered him a meinee of his sort to hoppe and singe and maken swich disport. and ther they setten steven for to mete to pleyen at the dys in swich a strete.  for in the toune nas ther no prentys  that fairer coude caste a paire of dys than perkin coude and therto he was free of his dispense in place of privetee. that fond his maister wel in his chaffare; for often tyme he fond his box ful bare.  for sikerly a prentis revelour that haunteth dys riot or paramour his maister shal it in his shoppe abye al have he no part of the minstralcye;  for thefte and riot they ben convertible  al conne he pleye on giterne or ribible. revel and trouthe as in a low degree they been ful wrothe al day as men may see. this ioly prentis with his maister bood til he were ny out of his prentishood  al were he snibbed bothe erly and late and somtyme lad with revel to newgate; but atte laste his maister him bithoghte upon a day whan he his paper soghte  of a proverbe that seith this same word  wel bet is roten appel out of hord than that it rotie al the remenaunt. so fareth it by a riotous servaunt; it is wel lasse harm to lete him pace than he shende alle the servants in the place.  therfore his maister yaf him acquitance and bad him go with sorwe and with meschance; and thus this ioly prentis hadde his leve. now lat him riote al the night or leve.  and for ther is no theef withoute a louke  that helpeth him to wasten and to souke of that he brybe can or borwe may anon he sente his bed and his array unto a compeer of his owne sort that lovede dys and revel and disport  and hadde a wyf that heeld for countenance a shoppe and swyved for hir sustenance.  of this cokes tale maked chaucer na more. the tale of gamelyn. litheth and lesteneth  and herkeneth aright and ye schulle heere a talking  of a doughty knight; sire iohan of boundys  was his righte name he cowde of norture ynough  and mochil of game. thre sones the knight hadde  that with his body he wan;  the eldest was a moche schrewe  and sone he bigan. his bretheren loved wel here fader  and of him were agast the eldest deserved his fadres curs  and had it at the last. the goode knight his fader  livede so yore that deth was comen him to  and handled him ful sore.  the goode knight cared sore  syk ther he lay how his children scholde  liven after his day. he hadde ben wydewher  but non housbond he was al the lond that he hadde  it was verrey purchas. fayn he wolde it were  dressed among hem alle  that ech of hem hadde his part  as it mighte falle. tho sente he into cuntre  after wyse knightes to helpe delen his londes  and dressen hem torightes. he sente hem word by lettres  they schulden hye blyve if they wolde speke with him  whyl he was on lyve.  tho the knightes herden  syk that he lay hadde they no reste  nother night ne day til they comen to him  ther he lay stille on his dethbedde  to abyde goddes wille. than seyde the goode knight  syk ther he lay  lordes i you warne  for soth withoute nay i may no lenger liven  heer in this stounde; for thurgh goddes wille  deth draweth me to grounde. ther nas non of hem alle  that herde him aright that they ne hadden reuthe  of that ilke knight  and seyde sir for goddes love  ne dismay you nought; god may do bote of bale  that is now ywrought. than spak the goode knight  syk ther he lay boote of bale god may sende  i wot it is no nay; but i byseke you knightes  for the love of me  goth and dresseth my lond  among my sones three. and sires for the love of god  deleth hem nat amis and forgetith nat gamelyn  my yonge sone that is. taketh heed to that on  as wel as to that other; selde ye see ony eyr  helpen his brother.  tho leete they the knight lyen  that was nought in hele and wenten into counsel  his londes for to dele; for to delen hem alle  to oon that was her thought and for gamelyn was yongest  he schulde have nought. al the lond that ther was  they dalten it in two  and leeten gamelyn the yonge  withoute londe go and ech of hem seyde  to other ful lowde his bretheren mighte yeve him lond  whan he good cowde. whan they hadde deled  the lond at here wille they comen ayein to the knight  ther he lay ful stille  and tolden him anonright  how they hadden wrought; and the knight ther he lay  lyked it right nought. than seyde the knight  by seynt martyn for al that ye have ydoon  yit is the lond myn; for goddes love neyhebours  stondeth alle stille  and i wil dele my lond  right after my wille. iohan myn eldeste sone  schal have plowes fyve that was my fadres heritage  whyl he was on lyve; and my middeleste sone  fyve plowes of lond that i halp for to gete  with my righte hond;  and al myn other purchas  of londes and leedes that i biquethe gamelyn  and alle my goode steedes. and i biseke yow goode men  that lawe conne of londe for gamelynes love  that my queste stonde. thus dalte the knight  his lond by his day  right on his dethbedde  syk ther he lay; and sone aftirward  he lay stoonstille and deyde whan tyme com  as it was cristes wille. and anon as he was deed  and under gras ygrave sone the elder brother  gyled the yonge knave;  he took into his hond  his lond and his leede and gamelyn himselfe  to clothen and to feede. he clothed him and fedde him  yvel and eek wrothe and leet his londes forfare  and his houses bothe his parkes and his woodes  and dede nothing wel;  and seththen he it aboughte  on his faire fel. so longe was gamelyn  in his brotheres halle for the strengest of good wil  they doutiden him alle; ther was non therinne  nowther yong ne old that wolde wraththe gamelyn  were he never so bold.  gamelyn stood on a day  in his brotheres yerde and bigan with his hond  to handlen his berde; he thoughte on his londes  that layen unsawe and his faire okes  that down were ydrawe; his parkes were ybroken  and his deer bireved;  of alle his goode steedes  noon was him bileved; his howses were unhiled  and ful yvel dight; tho thoughte gamelyn  it wente nought aright. afterward cam his brother  walkinge thare and seyde to gamelyn  is our mete yare?  tho wraththed him gamelyn  and swor by goddes book thou schalt go bake thyself  i wil nought be thy cook! how? brother gamelyn  how answerest thou now? thou spake never such a word  as thou dost now. by my faith seyde gamelyn  now me thinketh neede  of alle the harmes that i have  i tok never ar heede. my parkes ben tobroken  and my deer bireved of myn armure and my steedes  nought is me bileved; al that my fader me biquath  al goth to schame and therfor have thou goddes curs  brother by thy name!  than bispak his brother  that rape was of rees stond stille gadeling  and hold right thy pees; thou schalt be fayn for to have  thy mete and thy wede; what spekest thou gamelyn  of lond other of leede? thanne seyde gamelyn  the child that was ying  cristes curs mot he have  that clepeth me gadeling! i am no worse gadeling  ne no worse wight but born of a lady  and geten of a knight. ne durste he nat to gamelyn  ner afoote go but clepide to him his men  and seyde to hem tho  goth and beteth this boy  and reveth him his wit and lat him lerne another tyme  to answere me bet. thanne seyde the child  yonge gamelyn cristes curs mot thou have  brother art thou myn! and if i schal algate  be beten anon  cristes curs mot thou have  but thou be that oon! and anon his brother  in that grete hete made his men to fette staves  gamelyn to bete. whan that everich of hem  a staf hadde ynome gamelyn was war anon  tho he seigh hem come;  tho gamelyn seigh hem come  he loked overal and was war of a pestel  stood under a wal; gamelyn was light of foot  and thider gan he lepe and drof alle his brotheres men  right on an hepe. he loked as a wilde lyoun  and leyde on good woon;  tho his brother say that  he bigan to goon; he fley up intil a loft  and schette the dore fast; thus gamelyn with the pestel  made hem alle agast. some for gamelynes love  and some for his eye alle they drowe by halves  tho he gan to pleye.  what! how now? seyde gamelyn  evel mot ye thee! wil ye biginne contek  and so sone flee? gamelyn soughte his brother  whider he was flowe and saugh wher he loked  out at a windowe. brother sayde gamelyn  com a litel ner  and i wil teche thee a play  atte bokeler. his brother him answerde  and swor by seynt richer whyl the pestel is in thin hond  i wil come no neer: brother i wil make thy pees  i swere by cristes ore; cast away the pestel  and wraththe thee nomore.  i mot neede sayde gamelyn  wraththe me at oones for thou wolde make thy men  to breke myne boones ne hadde i had mayn  and might in myn armes to have yput hem fro me  they wolde have do me harmes. gamelyn sayde his brother  be thou nought wroth  for to seen thee have harm  it were me right loth; i ne dide it nought brother  but for a fonding for to loken if thou were strong  and art so ying. com adoun than to me  and graunte me my bone of thing i wil thee aske  and we schul saughte sone.  doun than cam his brother  that fikil was and fel and was swithe sore  agast of the pestel. he seyde brother gamelyn  aske me thy boone and loke thou me blame  but i graunte sone. thanne seyde gamelyn  brother ywis  and we schulle ben at oon  thou most me graunte this: al that my fader me biquath  whyl he was on lyve thou most do me it have  yif we schul nat stryve. that schalt thou have gamelyn  i swere by cristes ore! al that thy fader thee biquath  though thou woldest have more;  thy lond that lyth laye  ful wel it schal be sowe and thyn howses reysed up  that ben leyd so lowe. thus seyde the knight  to gamelyn with mowthe and thoughte eek of falsnes  as he wel couthe. the knight thoughte on tresoun  and gamelyn on noon  and wente and kiste his brother  and whan they were at oon allas! yonge gamelyn  nothing he ne wiste with which a false tresoun  his brother him kiste! litheth and lesteneth  and holdeth your tonge and ye schul heere talking  of gamelyn the yonge.  ther was ther bisyden  cryed a wrastling and therfor ther was set up  a ram and a ring; and gamelyn was in good wil  to wende therto for to preven his might  what he cowthe do. brother seyde gamelyn  by seynt richer  thou most lene me tonight  a litel courser that is freisch to the spore  on for to ryde; i most on an erande  a litel her bisyde. by god! seyde his brother  of steedes in my stalle go and chese thee the best  and spare non of alle  of steedes or of coursers  that stonden hem bisyde; and tel me goode brother  whider thou wolt ryde. her bisyde brother  is cryed a wrastling and therfor schal be set up  a ram and a ring; moche worschip it were  brother to us alle  might i the ram and the ring  bring home to this halle. a steede ther was sadeled  smertely and skeet; gamelyn did a paire spores  fast on his feet. he sette his foot in the styrop  the steede he bistrood and toward the wrasteling  the yonge child rood.  tho gamelyn the yonge  was ride out at the gat the false knight his brother  lokked it after that and bisoughte iesu crist  that is heven king he mighte breke his nekke  in that wrasteling. as sone as gamelyn com  ther the place was  he lighte doun of his steede  and stood on the gras and ther he herd a frankeleyn  wayloway singe and bigan bitterly  his hondes for to wringe. goode man seyde gamelyn  why makestow this fare? is ther no man that may  you helpe out of this care?  allas! seyde this frankeleyn  that ever was i bore! for tweye stalworthe sones  i wene that i have lore; a champioun is in the place  that hath ywrought me sorwe for he hath slayn my two sones  butif god hem borwe. i wold yeve ten pound  by iesu crist! and more  with the nones i fand a man  to handelen him sore. goode man sayde gamelyn  wilt thou wel doon hold myn hors whyl my man  draweth of my schoon and help my man to kepe  my clothes and my steede and i wil into place go  to loke if i may speede.  by god! sayde the frankeleyn  anon it schal be doon; i wil myself be thy man  and drawen of thy schoon and wende thou into the place  iesu crist thee speede and drede not of thy clothes  nor of thy goode steede. barfoot and ungert  gamelyn in cam  alle that weren in the place  heede of him they nam how he durste auntre him  of him to doon his might that was so doughty champioun  in wrastling and in fight. up sterte the champioun  rapely and anoon toward yonge gamelyn  he bigan to goon  and sayde who is thy fader  and who is thy sire? for sothe thou art a gret fool  that thou come hire! gamelyn answerde  the champioun tho thou knewe wel my fader  whyl he couthe go whyles he was on lyve  by seint martyn!  sir iohan of boundys was his name  and i gamelyn. felaw seyde the champioun  also mot i thryve i knew wel thy fader  whyl he was on lyve; and thyself gamelyn  i wil that thou it heere whyl thou were a yong boy  a moche schrewe thou were.  than seyde gamelyn  and swor by cristes ore now i am older woxe  thou schalt me finde a more! by god! sayde the champioun  welcome mote thou be! come thou ones in myn hond  schalt thou never thee. it was wel withinne the night  and the moone schon  whan gamelyn and the champioun  togider gonne goon. the champioun caste tornes  to gamelyn that was prest and gamelyn stood stille  and bad him doon his best. thanne seyde gamelyn  to the champioun thou art faste aboute  to bringe me adoun;  now i have yproved  many tornes of thyne thow most he seyde proven  on or two of myne. gamelyn to the champioun  yede smertely anon of all the tornes that he cowthe  he schewed him but oon and caste him on the lefte syde  that three ribbes tobrak  and therto his oon arm  that yaf a gret crak. thanne seyde gamelyn  smertely anoon schal it be holde for a cast  or elles for noon? by god! seyde the champioun  whether that it be he that cometh ones in thin hand  schal he never thee!  than seyde the frankeleyn  that had his sones there blessed be thou gamelyn  that ever thou bore were! the frankeleyn seyde to the champioun  of him stood him noon eye this is yonge gamelyn  that taughte thee this pleye. agein answerd the champioun  that lyked nothing wel  he is a lither mayster  and his pley is right fel; sith i wrastled first  it is ygo ful yore but i was nevere in my lyf  handeled so sore. gamelyn stood in the place  allone withoute serk and seyde if ther be eny mo  lat hem come to werk;  the champioun that peyned him  to werke so sore it semeth by his continaunce  that he wil nomore. gamelyn in the place  stood as stille as stoon for to abyde wrasteling  but ther com noon; ther was noon with gamelyn  wolde wrastle more  for he handled the champioun  so wonderly sore. two gentilmen ther were  that yemede the place comen to gamelyn  god yeve him goode grace! and sayde to him do on  thyn hosen and thy schoon for sothe at this tyme  this feire is ydoon.  and than seyde gamelyn  so mot i wel fare i have nought yet halvendel  sold up my ware. tho seyde the champioun  so brouke i my sweere he is a fool that therof byeth  thou sellest it so deere. tho sayde the frankeleyn  that was in moche care  felaw he seyde  why lakkest thou his ware? by seynt iame in galys  that many man hath sought yet it is to good cheep  that thou hast ybought. tho that wardeynes were  of that wrasteling come and broughte gamelyn  the ram and the ring  and seyden have gamelyn  the ring and the ram for the beste wrasteler  that ever here cam. thus wan gamelyn  the ram and the ring and wente with moche ioye  home in the morning. his brother seih wher he cam  with the grete rowte  and bad schitte the gate  and holde him withoute. the porter of his lord  was ful sore agast and sterte anon to the gate  and lokked it fast. now litheth and lesteneth  bothe yonge and olde and ye schul heere gamen  of gamelyn the bolde.  gamelyn come therto  for to have comen in and thanne was it yschet  faste with a pin; than seyde gamelyn  porter undo the yat for many good mannes sone  stondeth therat. than answerd the porter  and swor by goddes berde  thow ne schalt gamelyn  come into this yerde. thow lixt sayde gamelyn  so browke i my chin! he smot the wiket with his foot  and brak awey the pin. the porter seyh tho  it might no better be he sette foot on erthe  and bigan to flee.  by my faith seyde gamelyn  that travail is ylore for i am of foot as light as thou  though thou haddest swore. gamelyn overtook the porter  and his teene wrak and gerte him in the nekke  that the bon tobrak and took him by that oon arm  and threw him in a welle  seven fadmen it was deep  as i have herd telle. whan gamelyn the yonge  thus hadde pleyd his play alle that in the yerde were  drewen hem away; they dredden him ful sore  for werkes that he wroughte and for the faire company  that he thider broughte.  gamelyn yede to the gate  and leet it up wyde; he leet in alle maner men  that gon in wolde or ryde and seyde ye be welcome  withouten eny greeve for we wiln be maistres heer  and aske no man leve. yestirday i lefte  seyde yonge gamelyn  in my brother seller  fyve tonne of wyn; i wil not that this compaignye  parten atwinne and ye wil doon after me  whyl eny sope is thrinne and if my brother grucche  or make foul cheere other for spense of mete or drink  that we spenden heere  i am oure catour  and bere oure aller purs he schal have for his grucching  seint maries curs. my brother is a niggoun  i swer by cristes ore and we wil spende largely  that he hath spared yore; and who that maketh grucching  that we here dwelle  he schal to the porter  into the drawwelle. seven dayes and seven night  gamelyn held his feste with moche mirth and solas  that was ther and no cheste; in a little toret  his brother lay ysteke and sey hem wasten his good  but durste he not speke.  erly on a morning  on the eighte day the gestes come to gamelyn  and wolde gon here way. lordes seyde gamelyn  wil ye so hye? al the wyn is not yet dronke  so brouke i myn ye. gamelyn in his herte  was he ful wo  whan his gestes took her leve  from him for to go; he wolde they had lenger abide  and they seyde nay but bitaughte gamelyn  god and good day. thus made gamelyn his feest  and broughte it wel to ende and after his gestes  toke leve to wende.  litheth and lesteneth  and holdeth youre tonge and ye schul heere gamen  of gamelyn the yonge; herkeneth lordinges  and lesteneth aright whan alle gestes were goon  how gamelyn was dight. al the whyl that gamelyn  heeld his mangerye  his brother thoughte on him be wreke  with his treccherye. tho gamelyns gestes  were riden and ygoon gamelyn stood allone  frendes had he noon; tho after ful soone  withinne a litel stounde gamelyn was ytaken  and ful harde ybounde.  forth com the false knight  out of the soleer to gamelyn his brother  he yede ful neer and sayde to gamelyn  who made thee so bold for to stroye my stoor  of myn houshold? brother seyde gamelyn  wraththe thee right nought  for it is many day ygon  siththen it was bought; for brother thou hast yhad  by seynt richer of fiftene plowes of lond  this sixtene yer and of alle the beestes  thou hast forth bred that my fader me biquath  on his dethbed;  of al this sixtene yeer  i yeve thee the prow for the mete and the drink  that we have spended now. thanne seyde the false knight  evel mot he thee! herkne brother gamelyn  what i wol yeve thee; for of my body brother  heir geten have i noon  i wil make thee myn heir  i swere by seint iohan. par ma foy! sayde gamelyn  and if it so be and thou thenke as thou seyst  god yelde it thee! nothing wiste gamelyn  of his brotheres gyle; therfore he him bigyled  in a litel whyle.  gamelyn seyde he  o thing i thee telle; tho thou threwe my porter  in the drawwelle i swor in that wraththe  and in that grete moot that thou schuldest be bounde  bothe hand and foot; therfore i thee biseche  brother gamelyn  lat me nought be forsworen  brother art thou myn; lat me binde thee now  bothe hand and feet for to holde myn avow  as i thee biheet. brother sayde gamelyn  also mot i thee! thou schalt not be forsworen  for the love of me.  tho made they gamelyn to sitte  mighte he nat stonde til they hadde him bounde  bothe foot and honde. the false knight his brother  of gamelyn was agast and sente aftir feteres  to feteren him fast. his brother made lesinges  on him ther he stood  and tolde hem that comen in  that gamelyn was wood. gamelyn stood to a post  bounden in the halle tho that comen in ther  lokede on him alle. ever stood gamelyn  even upright; but mete ne drink had he non  neither day ne night.  than seyde gamelyn  brother by myn hals now i have aspyed  thou art a party fals; had i wist that tresoun  that thou haddest yfounde i wolde have yeve thee strokes  or i had be bounde! gamelyn stood bounden  stille as eny stoon;  two dayes and two nightes  mete had he noon. thanne seyde gamelyn  that stood ybounde stronge adam spenser  me thinkth i faste to longe; adam spenser  now i byseche thee for the mochel love  my fader loved thee  if thou may come to the keyes  lese me out of bond and i wil parte with thee  of my free lond. thanne seyde adam  that was the spencer i have served thy brother  this sixtene yeer if i leete thee goon  out of his bour  he wolde say afterward  i were a traytour. adam sayde gamelyn  so brouke i myn hals! thou schalt finde my brother  atte laste fals; therfor brother adam  louse me out of bond and i wil parte with thee  of my free lond.  up swich a forward  seyde adam ywis i wil do therto  al that in me is. adam seyde gamelyn  also mot i thee i wol holde thee covenant  and thou wil me. anon as adames lord  to bedde was ygoon  adam took the keyes and leet  gamelyn out anoon; he unlokked gamelyn  bothe handes and feet in hope of avauncement  that he him biheet. than seyde gamelyn  thanked be goddes sonde! now i am loosed  bothe foot and honde;  had i now eten  and dronken aright ther is noon in this hous  schulde binde me this night. adam took gamelyn  as stille as ony stoon and ladde him into spence  rapely and anon and sette him to soper  right in a privee stede  he bad him do gladly  and gamelyn so dede. anon as gamelyn hadde  eten wel and fyn and therto ydronke wel  of the rede wyn adam seyde gamelyn  what is now thy reed? wher i go to my brother  and girde of his heed?  gamelyn seyde adam  it schal not be so. i can teche thee a reed  that is worth the two. i wot wel for sothe  that this is no nay we schul have a mangery  right on soneday; abbotes and priours  many heer schal be  and other men of holy chirche  as i telle thee; thow schalt stonde up by the post  as thou were hondfast and i schal leve hem unloke  awey thou may hem cast. whan that they have eten  and wasschen here hondes thou schalt biseke hem alle  to bring thee out of bondes;  and if they wille borwe thee  that were good game then were thou out of prisoun  and i out of blame; and if everich of hem  say unto us nay i schal do an other  i swere by this day! thou schalt have a good staf  and i wil have another  and cristes curs have that oon  that faileth that other! ye for gode! sayde gamelyn  i say it for me if i fayle on my syde  yvel mot i thee! if we schul algate  assoile hem of here sinne warne me brother adam  whan i schal biginne.  gamelyn seyde adam  by seynte charite i wil warne thee biforn  whan that it schal be; whan i twinke on thee  loke for to goon and cast awey the feteres  and com to me anoon. adam seide gamelyn  blessed be thy bones!  that is a good counseil  yeven for the nones; if they werne me thanne  to bringe me out of bendes i wol sette goode strokes  right on here lendes. tho the sonday was ycome  and folk to the feste faire they were welcomed  both leste and meste;  and ever atte halledore  as they comen in they caste their eye  on yonge gamelyn. the false knight his brother  ful of trechery alle the gestes that ther were  atte mangery of gamelyn his brother  he tolde hem with mouthe  al the harm and the schame  that he telle couthe. tho they were served  of messes two or three than seyde gamelyn  how serve ye me? it is nought wel served  by god that al made! that i sitte fasting  and other men make glade.  the false knight his brother  ther that he stood tolde alle his gestes  that gamelyn was wood; and gamelyn stood stille  and answerde nought but adames wordes  he held in his thought. tho gamelyn gan speke  dolfully withalle  to the grete lordes  that saten in the halle: lordes he seyde  for cristes passioun helpeth bringe gamelyn  out of prisoun. than seyde an abbot  sorwe on his cheeke! he schal have cristes curs  and seynte maries eeke  that thee out of prisoun  beggeth other borwe but ever worthe hem wel  that doth thee moche sorwe. after that abbot  than spak another i wold thin heed were of  though thou were my brother! alle that thee borwe  foule mot hem falle!  thus they seyden alle  that weren in the halle. than seyde a priour  yvel mot he thryve! it is moche scathe boy  that thou art on lyve. ow! seyde gamelyn  so brouke i my bon! now i have aspyed  that freendes have i non.  cursed mot he worthe  bothe fleisch and blood that ever do priour  or abbot ony good! adam the spencer  took up the cloth and loked on gamelyn  and say that he was wroth; adam on the pantrye  litel he thoughte  but two goode staves  to halledore he broughte adam loked on gamelyn  and he was war anoon and caste awey the feteres  and he bigan to goon: tho he com to adam  he took that oo staf and bigan to worche  and goode strokes yaf.  gamelyn cam into the halle  and the spencer bothe and loked hem aboute  as they had be wrothe; gamelyn sprengeth holywater  with an oken spire that some that stoode upright  fellen in the fire. there was no lewed man  that in the halle stood  that wolde do gamelyn  eny thing but good but stood bisyden  and leet hem bothe werche for they hadde no rewthe  of men of holy cherche; abbot or priour  monk or chanoun that gamelyn overtok  anon they yeeden doun.  ther was non of hem alle  that with his staf mette that he ne made him overthrowe  and quitte him his dette. gamelyn seyde adam  for seynte charite pay large liverey  for the love of me and i wil kepe the dore  so ever here i masse!  er they ben assoyled  there shal noon passe. dowt thee nought seyde gamelyn  whyl we ben infeere kep thou wel the dore  and i wol werche heere; stere thee good adam  and lat ther noon flee and we schul telle largely  how many that ther be.  gamelyn seyde adam  do hem but good; they ben men of holy chirche  draw of hem no blood save wel the croune  and do hem non harmes but brek bothe her legges  and siththen here armes. thus gamelyn and adam  wroughte right fast  and pleyden with the monkes  and made hem agast. thider they come ryding  iolily with swaynes and hom ayen they were ylad  in cartes and in waynes. tho they hadden al ydon  than seyde a gray frere allas! sire abbot  what dide we now heere?  tho that we comen hider  it was a cold reed us hadde ben better at home  with water and with breed. whyl gamelyn made ordres  of monkes and frere ever stood his brother  and made foul chere; gamelyn up with his staf  that he wel knew  and gerte him in the nekke  that he overthrew; a litel above the girdel  the riggebon tobarst; and sette him in the feteres  ther he sat arst. sitte ther brother  sayde gamelyn for to colen thy blood  as i dide myn.  as swithe as they hadde  ywroken hem on here foon they askeden watir  and wisschen anoon what some for here love  and some for here awe alle the servants served hem  of the beste lawe. the scherreve was thennes  but a fyve myle  and al was ytold him  in a litel whyle how gamelyn and adam  had doon a sory rees bounden and ywounded men  ayein the kinges pees; tho bigan sone  stryf for to wake and the scherref was aboute  gamelyn for to take.  now lytheth and lesteneth  so god yif you good fyn! and ye schul heere good game  of yonge gamelyn. four and twenty yonge men  that heelden hem ful bolde come to the schirref  and seyde that they wolde gamelyn and adam  fetten by her fay;  the scherref yaf hem leve  soth as i you say; they hyeden faste  wold they nought bilinne til they come to the gate  ther gamelyn was inne. they knokked on the gate  the porter was ny and loked out at an hol  as man that was sly.  the porter hadde biholde  hem a litel whyle he loved wel gamelyn  and was adrad of gyle and leet the wicket stonden  ysteke ful stille and asked hem withoute  what was here wille. for al the grete company  thanne spak but oon  undo the gate porter  and lat us in goon. than seyde the porter  so brouke i my chin ye schul sey your erand  er ye comen in. sey to gamelyn and adam  if here wille be we wil speke with hem  wordes two or thre.  felaw seyde the porter  stond there stille and i wil wende to gamelyn  to witen his wille. in wente the porter  to gamelyn anoon and seyde sir i warne you  her ben come your foon; the scherreves meyne  ben atte gate  for to take you bothe  schulle ye nat scape. porter seyde gamelyn  so moot i wel thee! i wil allowe thee thy wordes  whan i my tyme see; go agayn to the yate  and dwel with hem a whyle and thou schalt see right sone  porter a gyle.  adam sayde gamelyn  looke thee to goon; we have foomen atte gate  and frendes never oon; it ben the schirrefes men  that hider ben ycome they ben swore togidere  that we schul be nome. gamelyn seyde adam  hye thee right blyve  and if i faile thee this day  evel mot i thryve! and we schul so welcome  the scherreves men that some of hem schul make  here beddes in the fen. atte posternegate  gamelyn out wente and a good cartstaf  in his hand he hente;  adam hente sone  another gret staf for to helpe gamelyn  and goode strokes yaf. adam felde tweyne  and gamelyn felde three the other setten feet on erthe  and bigonne flee. what? seyde adam  so ever here i masse!  i have a draught of good wyn!  drink er ye passe! nay by god! sayde thay  thy drink is not good it wolde make mannes brayn  to lyen in his hood. gamelyn stood stille  and loked him aboute and seih the scherreve come  with a gret route.  adam seyde gamelyn  what be now thy reedes? here cometh the scherreve  and wil have cure heedes. adam sayde gamelyn  my reed is now this abyde we no lenger  lest we fare amis: i rede that we to wode goon  ar that we be founde  better is us ther loos  than in town ybounde. adam took by the hond  yonge gamelyn; and everich of hem two  drank a draught of wyn and after took her cours  and wenten her way; tho fond the scherreve  nest but non ay.  the scherreve lighte adoun  and went into the halle and fond the lord yfetered  faste withalle. the scherreve unfetered him  sone and that anoon and sente after a leche  to hele his riggeboon. lete we now this false knight  lyen in his care  and talke we of gamelyn  and loke how he fare. gamelyn into the woode  stalkede stille and adam the spenser  lykede ful ille; adam swor to gamelyn  by seynt richer now i see it is mery  to be a spencer  that lever me were  keyes for to bere than walken in this wilde woode  my clothes to tere. adam seyde gamelyn  dismaye thee right nought; many good mannes child  in care is ybrought. and as they stoode talking  bothen infeere  adam herd talking of men  and neyh him thought they were. tho gamelyn under the woode  lokede aright sevene score of yonge men  he saugh wel adight; alle satte atte mete  in compas aboute. adam seyde gamelyn  now have we no doute  after bale cometh boote  thurgh grace of god almight; me thinketh of mete and drink  that i have a sight. adam lokede tho  under woodebowgh and whan he seyh mete  he was glad ynough; for he hopede to god  for to have his deel  and he was sore alonged  after a good meel. as he seyde that word  the mayster outlawe saugh gamelyn and adam  under woodeschawe. yonge men seyde the maister  by the goode roode i am war of gestes  god sende us non but goode;  yonder ben two yonge men  wonder wel adight and paraventure ther ben mo  whoso lokede aright. ariseth up ye yonge men  and fetteth hem to me; it is good that we witen  what men they be. up ther sterten sevene  fro the diner  and metten with gamelyn  and adam spenser. whan they were neyh hem  than seyde that oon yeldeth up yonge men  your bowes and your floon. thanne seyde gamelyn  that yong was of elde moche sorwe mot he have  that to you hem yelde!  i curse non other  but right myselve; they ye fette to yow fyve  thanne ye be twelve! tho they herde by his word  that might was in his arm ther was non of hem alle  that wolde do him harm but sayde unto gamelyn  mildely and stille  com afore our maister  and sey to him thy wille. yonge men sayde gamelyn  by your lewte what man is your maister  that ye with be? alle they answerde  withoute lesing oure maister is ycrouned  of outlawes king.  adam seyde gamelyn  gowe in cristes name; he may neyther mete nor drink  werne us for schame. if that he be hende  and come of gentil blood he wol yeve us mete and drink  and doon us som good. by seynt iame! seyde adam  what harm that i gete  i wil auntre to the dore  that i hadde mete. gamelyn and adam  wente forth infeere and they grette the maister  that they founde there. than seide the maister  king of outlawes what seeke ye yonge men  under woodeschawes?  gamelyn answerde  the king with his croune he moste needes walke in woode  that may not walke in towne. sire we walke not heer  noon harm for to do butif we meete with a deer  to scheete therto as men that ben hungry  and mow no mete finde  and ben harde bistad  under woodelinde. of gamelynes wordes  the maister hadde routhe and seyde ye schal have ynough  have god my trouthe! he bad hem sitte ther adoun  for to take reste; and bad hem ete and drinke  and that of the beste.  as they sete and eeten  and dronke wel and fyn than seyde that oon to that other  this is gamelyn. tho was the maister outlawe  into counseil nome and told how it was gamelyn  that thider was ycome. anon as he herde  how it was bifalle  he made him maister under him  over hem alle. within the thridde wyke  him com tyding to the maister outlawe  that tho was her king that he schulde come hom  his pees was ymad; and of that goode tyding  he was tho ful glad.  tho seyde he to his yonge men  soth for to telle me ben comen tydinges  i may no lenger dwelle. tho was gamelyn anon  withoute tarying maad maister outlawe  and crouned here king. tho was gamelyn crouned  king of outlawes  and walked a whyle  under woodeschawes. the false knight his brother  was scherreve and sire and leet his brother endite  for hate and for ire. tho were his bondemen  sory and nothing glad when gamelyn her lord  wolvesheed was cryed and maad; and sente out of his men  wher they might him finde  for to seke gamelyn  under woodelinde to telle him tydinges  how the wind was went and al his good reved  and his men schent. whan they had him founde  on knees they hem sette  and adoun with here hood  and here lord grette; sire wraththe you nought  for the goode roode for we have brought you tydinges  but they be nat goode. now is thy brother scherreve  and hath the baillye and he hath endited thee  and wolvesheed doth thee crye.  allas! seyde gamelyn  that ever i was so slak that i ne hadde broke his nekke  tho i his rigge brak! goth greteth hem wel  myn housbondes and wyf i wol ben atte nexte schire  have god my lyf! gamelyn com wel redy  to the nexte schire  and ther was his brother  bothe lord and sire. gamelyn com boldelich  into the moothalle and putte adoun his hood  among the lordes alle; god save you alle lordinges  that now here be! but brokebak scherreve  evel mot thou thee!  why hast thou do me  that schame and vilonye for to late endite me  and wolvesheed me crye? tho thoughte the false knight  for to ben awreke and leet take gamelyn  moste he no more speke; might ther be no more grace  but gamelyn atte laste  was cast into prisoun  and fetered ful faste. gamelyn hath a brother  that highte sir ote as good a knight and hende  as mighte gon on foote. anon ther yede a messager  to that goode knight and tolde him altogidere  how gamelyn was dight.  anon as sire ote herde  how gamelyn was adight he was wonder sory  was he nothing light and leet sadle a steede  and the way he nam and to his tweyne bretheren  anonright he cam. sire seyde sire ote  to the scherreve tho  we ben but three bretheren  schul we never be mo; and thou hast yprisoned  the beste of us alle; swich another brother  yvel mot him bifalle! sire ote seide the false knight  lat be thy curs; by god for thy wordes  he schal fare the wurs;  to the kinges prisoun  anon he is ynome and ther he schal abyde  til the iustice come. parde! seyde sir ote  better it schal be; i bidde him to maynpris  that thou graunte him me til the nexte sitting  of deliveraunce  and thanne lat gamelyn  stande to his chaunce. brother in swich a forward  i take him to thee; and by thy fader soule  that thee bigat and me butif he be redy  whan the iustice sitte thou schalt bere the iuggement  for al thy grete witte.  i graunte wel seide sir ote  that it so be. let deliver him anon  and tak him to me. tho was gamelyn delivered  to sire ote his brother and that night dwellede  that on with that other. on the morn seyde gamelyn  to sire ote the hende  brother he seide i moot  for sothe from thee wende to loke how my yonge men  leden here lyf whether they liven in ioye  or elles in stryf. by god! seyde sire ote  that is a cold reed now i see that al the cark  schal fallen on myn heed;  for when the iustice sitte  and thou be nought yfounde i schal anon be take  and in thy stede ybounde. brother sayde gamelyn  dismaye thee nought for by seint iame in gales  that many man hath sought if that god almighty  holde my lyf and wit  i wil be ther redy  whan the iustice sit. than seide sir ote to gamelyn  god schilde thee fro schame; com whan thou seest tyme  and bring us out of blame. litheth and lesteneth  and holdeth you stille and ye schul here how gamelyn  hadde al his wille.  gamelyn wente ayein  under wooderys and fond there pleying  yonge men of prys. tho was yong gamelyn  glad and blithe ynough whan he fond his mery men  under woodebough. gamelyn and his men  talkeden infeere  and they hadde good game  here maister to heere; they tolden him of aventures  that they hadde founde and gamelyn hem tolde ayein  how he was fast ybounde. whyl gamelyn was outlawed  hadde he no cors; there was no man that for him  ferde the wors  but abbotes and priours  monk and chanoun; on hem left he nothing  whan he mighte hem nom. whyl gamelyn and his men  made merthes ryve the false knight his brother  yvel mot he thryve! for he was fast aboute  bothe day and other  for to hyre the quest  to hangen his brother. gamelyn stood on a day  and as he biheeld the woodes and the schawes  in the wilde feeld he thoughte on his brother  how he him beheet that he wolde be redy  whan the iustice seet;  he thoughte wel that he wolde  withoute delay come afore the iustice  to kepen his day and seide to his yonge men  dighteth you yare for whan the iustice sitte  we moote be thare for i am under borwe  til that i come  and my brother for me  to prisoun schal be nome. by seint iame! seyde his yonge men  and thou rede therto ordeyne how it schal be  and it schal be do. whyl gamelyn was coming  ther the iustice sat the false knight his brother  foryat he nat that  to huyre the men on his quest  to hangen his brother; though he hadde nought that oon  he wolde have that other. tho cam gamelyn  fro under wooderys and broughte with him  his yonge men of prys. i see wel seyde gamelyn  the iustice is set;  go aforn adam  and loke how it spet. adam wente into the halle  and loked al aboute he seyh there stonde  lordes grete and stoute and sir ote his brother  fetered wel fast; tho went adam out of halle  as he were agast.  adam said to gamelyn  and to his felawes alle sir ote stant yfetered  in the moothalle. yonge men seide gamelyn  this ye heeren alle; sire ote stant yfetered  in the moothalle. if god yif us grace  wel for to doo  he schal it abegge  that broughte him thertoo. thanne sayde adam  that lokkes hadde hore cristes curs mote he have  that him bond so sore! and thou wilt gamelyn  do after my reed ther is noon in the halle  schal bere awey his heed.  adam seyde gamelyn  we wiln nought don so we wil slee the giltif  and lat the other go. i wil into the halle  and with the iustice speke; on hem that ben gultif  i wil ben awreke. lat non scape at the dore  take yonge men yeme;  for i wil be iustice this day  domes for to deme. god spede me this day  at my newe werk! adam com on with me  for thou schalt be my clerk. his men answereden him  and bade him doon his best and if thou to us have neede  thou schalt finde us prest;  we wiln stande with thee  whyl that we may dure and but we werke manly  pay us non hure. yonge men seyde gamelyn  so mot i wel thee! as trusty a maister  ye schal finde of me. right there the iustice  sat in the halle  in wente gamelyn  amonges hem alle. gamelyn leet unfetere  his brother out of bende. thanne seyde sire ote  his brother that was hende thou haddest almost gamelyn  dwelled to longe for the quest is oute on me  that i schulde honge.  brother seyde gamelyn  so god yif me good rest! this day they schuln ben hanged  that ben on thy quest; and the iustice bothe  that is the iuggeman and the scherreve bothe  thurgh him it bigan. thanne seyde gamelyn  to the iustise  now is thy power ydon  thou most nedes arise; thow hast yeven domes  that ben yvel dight i wil sitten in thy sete  and dressen hem aright. the iustice sat stille  and roos nought anoon; and gamelyn clevede  atwo his cheekeboon;  gamelyn took him in his arm  and no more spak but threw him over the barre  and his arm tobrak. durste non to gamelyn  seye but good for ferd of the company  that withoute stood. gamelyn sette him doun  in the iustices seet  and sire ote his brother by him  and adam at his feet. whan gamelyn was yset  in the iustices stede herkneth of a bourde  that gamelyn dede. he leet fetre the iustice  and his false brother and dede hem come to the barre  that oon with that other.  tho gamelyn hadde thus ydoon  hadde he no reste til he had enquered  who was on the queste for to deme his brother  sir ote for to honge; er he wiste which they were  him thoughte ful longe. but as sone as gamelyn  wiste wher they were  he dede hem everichone  feteren infeere and bringen hem to the barre  and sette hem in rewe; by my faith! seyde the iustice  the scherreve is a schrewe! than seyde gamelyn  to the iustise thou hast yyeve domes  of the wors assise;  and the twelve sisours  that weren of the queste they schul ben hanged this day  so have i good reste! thanne seide the scherreve  to yonge gamelyn lord i crye the mercy  brother art thou myn. therfore seyde gamelyn  have thou cristes curs  for and thou were maister  yit i schulde have wors. for to make short tale  and nought to tarie longe he ordeyned him a queste  of his men so stronge; the iustice and the scherreve  bothe honged hye to weyven with the ropes  and with the winde drye;  and the twelve sisours  sorwe have that rekke! alle they were hanged  faste by the nekke. thus ended the false knight  with his treccherye that ever hadde ylad his lyf  in falsnes and folye. he was hanged by the nekke  and nought by the purs;  that was the meede that he hadde  for his fadres curs. sire ote was eldest  and gamelyn was ying they wenten with here frendes  even to the king; they made pees with the king  of the best assise. the king loved wel sir ote  and made him iustise.  and after the king made gamelyn  bothe in est and west chief iustice  of al his free forest; alle his wighte yonge men  the king foryaf here gilt and sitthen in good office  the king hem hath ypilt. thus wan gamelyn  his lond and his leede  and wrak him of his enemys  and quitte hem here meede; and sire ote his brother  made him his heir and siththen wedded gamelyn  a wyf bothe good and feyr; they liveden togidere  whyl that crist wolde and sithen was gamelyn  graven under molde.  and so schal we alle  may ther no man flee: god bringe us to the ioye  that ever schal be! the wordes of the hoost to the companye. our hoste sey wel that the brighte sonne the ark of his artificial day had ronne the fourthe part and half an houre and more; and though he were not depe expert in lore he wiste it was the eightetethe day  of april that is messager to may; and sey wel that the shadwe of every tree was as in lengthe the same quantitee that was the body erect that caused it. and therfor by the shadwe he took his wit  that phebus which that shoon so clere and brighte degrees was fyve and fourty clombe on highte; and for that day as in that latitude it was ten of the clokke he gan conclude and sodeynly he plighte his hors aboute.  lordinges quod he i warne yow al this route the fourthe party of this day is goon; now for the love of god and of seint iohn leseth no tyme as ferforth as ye may; lordinges the tyme wasteth night and day  and steleth from us what prively slepinge and what thurgh necligence in our wakinge as dooth the streem that turneth never agayn descending fro the montaigne into playn. wel can senek and many a philosophre  biwailen tyme more than gold in cofre. for los of catel may recovered be but los of tyme shendeth us quod he. it wol nat come agayn withouten drede na more than wol malkins maydenhede  whan she hath lost it in hir wantownesse; lat us nat moulen thus in ydelnesse. sir man of lawe quod he so have ye blis tel us a tale anon as forward is; ye been submitted thurgh your free assent  to stonde in this cas at my iugement. acquiteth yow and holdeth your biheste than have ye doon your devoir atte leste. hoste quod he depardieux ich assente to breke forward is not myn entente.  biheste is dette and i wol holde fayn al my biheste; i can no better seyn. for swich lawe as man yeveth another wight he sholde himselven usen it by right; thus wol our text; but natheles certeyn  i can right now no thrifty tale seyn but chaucer though he can but lewedly on metres and on ryming craftily hath seyd hem in swich english as he can of olde tyme as knoweth many a man.  and if he have not seyd hem leve brother in o book he hath seyd hem in another. for he hath told of loveres up and doun mo than ovyde made of mencioun in his epistelles that been ful olde.  what sholde i tellen hem sin they ben tolde? in youthe he made of ceys and alcion and sithen hath he spoke of everichon thise noble wyves and thise loveres eke. whoso that wol his large volume seke  cleped the seintes legende of cupyde ther may he seen the large woundes wyde of lucresse and of babilan tisbee; the swerd of dido for the false enee; the tree of phillis for hir demophon;  the pleinte of dianire and hermion of adriane and of isiphilee; the bareyne yle stonding in the see; the dreynte leander for his erro;

 on many a sory meel now may she bayte; after her deeth ful often may she wayte er that the wilde wawes wole hir dryve  unto the place ther she shal arryve. men mighten asken why she was not slayn?  eek at the feste who mighte hir body save? and i answere to that demaunde agayn who saved daniel in the horrible cave ther every wight save he maister and knave was with the leoun frete er he asterte?  no wight but god that he bar in his herte. god liste to shewe his wonderful miracle in hir for we sholde seen his mighty werkes;  crist which that is to every harm triacle by certein menes ofte as knowen clerkes  doth thing for certein ende that ful derk is to mannes wit that for our ignorance ne conne not knowe his prudent purveyance. now sith she was not at the feste yslawe who kepte hir fro the drenching in the see?  who kepte ionas in the fisshes mawe til he was spouted up at ninivee? wel may men knowe it was no wight but he  that kepte peple ebraik fro hir drenchinge with drye feet thurghout the see passinge.  who bad the foure spirits of tempest that power han tanoyen land and see bothe north and south and also west and est anoyeth neither see ne land ne tree? sothly the comaundour of that was he  that fro the tempest ay this womman kepte as wel whan that she wook as whan she slepte. wher mighte this womman mete and drinke have?  three yeer and more how lasteth hir vitaille? who fedde the egipcien marie in the cave  or in desert? no wight but crist sans faille. fyve thousand folk it was as gret mervaille with loves fyve and fisshes two to fede. god sente his foison at hir grete nede. she dryveth forth into our occean  thurghout our wilde see til atte laste under an hold that nempnen i ne can fer in northumberlond the wawe hir caste  and in the sond hir ship stiked so faste that thennes wolde it noght of al a tyde  the wille of crist was that she shulde abyde. the constable of the castel doun is fare to seen this wrak and al the ship he soghte and fond this wery womman ful of care; he fond also the tresor that she broghte.  in hir langage mercy she bisoghte the lyf out of hir body for to twinne hir to delivere of wo that she was inne.  a maner latin corrupt was hir speche but algates therby was she understonde;  the constable whan him list no lenger seche this woful womman broghte he to the londe; she kneleth doun and thanketh goddes sonde. but what she was she wolde no man seye for foul ne fair thogh that she shulde deye.  she seyde she was so mased in the see that she forgat hir minde by hir trouthe; the constable hath of hir so greet pitee  and eek his wyf that they wepen for routhe she was so diligent withouten slouthe  to serve and plesen everich in that place that alle hir loven that loken on hir face. this constable and dame hermengild his wyf were payens and that contree everywhere; but hermengild lovede hir right as hir lyf  and custance hath so longe soiourned there in orisons with many a bitter tere til iesu hath converted thurgh his grace  dame hermengild constablesse of that place. in al that lond no cristen durste route  alle cristen folk ben fled fro that contree thurgh payens that conquereden al aboute the plages of the north by land and see; to walis fled the cristianitee of olde britons dwellinge in this yle;  ther was hir refut for the mene whyle. but yet nere cristen britons so exyled that ther nere somme that in hir privetee  honoured crist and hethen folk bigyled; and ny the castel swiche ther dwelten three.  that oon of hem was blind and mighte nat see but it were with thilke yen of his minde with whiche men seen after that they ben blinde. bright was the sonne as in that someres day for which the constable and his wyf also  and custance han ytake the righte way toward the see a furlong wey or two to pleyen and to romen to and fro;  and in hir walk this blinde man they mette croked and old with yen faste yshette.  in name of crist cryde this blinde britoun dame hermengild yif me my sighte agayn. this lady wex affrayed of the soun lest that hir housbond shortly for to sayn wolde hir for iesu cristes love han slayn  til custance made hir bold and bad hir werche the wil of crist as doghter of his chirche. the constable wex abasshed of that sight  and seyde what amounteth al this fare? custance answerde sire it is cristes might  that helpeth folk out of the feendes snare. and so ferforth she gan our lay declare that she the constable er that it were eve converted and on crist made him bileve. this constable was nothing lord of this place  of which i speke ther he custance fond but kepte it strongly many wintres space under alla king of al northumberlond  that was ful wys and worthy of his hond agayn the scottes as men may wel here  but turne i wol agayn to my matere. sathan that ever us waiteth to bigyle saugh of custance al hir perfeccioun and caste anon how he mighte quyte hir whyle and made a yong knight that dwelte in that toun  love hir so hote of foul affeccioun that verraily him thoughte he shulde spille but he of hir mighte ones have his wille.  he woweth hir but it availleth noght she wolde do no sinne by no weye;  and for despyt he compassed in his thoght to maken hir on shamful deth to deye. he wayteth whan the constable was aweye and prively upon a night he crepte in hermengildes chambre whyl she slepte.  wery forwaked in her orisouns slepeth custance and hermengild also. this knight thurgh sathanas temptaciouns  al softely is to the bed ygo and kitte the throte of hermengild atwo  and leyde the blody knyf by dame custance and wente his wey ther god yeve him meschance! sone after comth this constable hoom agayn and eek alla that king was of that lond and saugh his wyf despitously yslayn  for which ful ofte he weep and wrong his hond and in the bed the blody knyf he fond by dame custance; allas! what mighte she seye?  for verray wo hir wit was al aweye. to king alla was told al this meschance  and eek the tyme and where and in what wyse that in a ship was founden dame custance as heerbiforn that ye han herd devyse. the kinges herte of pitee gan agryse whan he saugh so benigne a creature  falle in disese and in misaventure. for as the lomb toward his deeth is broght so stant this innocent bifore the king;  this false knight that hath this tresoun wroght berth hir on hond that she hath doon this thing.  but nathelees ther was greet moorning among the peple and seyn they can not gesse that she hath doon so greet a wikkednesse. for they han seyn hir ever so vertuous and loving hermengild right as her lyf.  of this bar witnesse everich in that hous save he that hermengild slow with his knyf. this gentil king hath caught a gret motyf  of this witnesse and thoghte he wolde enquere depper in this a trouthe for to lere.  allas! custance! thou hast no champioun ne fighte canstow nought so weylawey! but he that starf for our redempcioun and bond sathan and yit lyth ther he lay so be thy stronge champioun this day!  for butif crist open miracle kythe withouten gilt thou shalt be slayn as swythe. she sette her doun on knees and thus she sayde  immortal god that savedest susanne fro false blame and thou merciful mayde  mary i mene doghter to seint anne bifore whos child aungeles singe osanne if i be giltlees of this felonye my socour be for elles i shal dye! have ye nat seyn som tyme a pale face  among a prees of him that hath be lad toward his deeth wheras him gat no grace and swich a colour in his face hath had  men mighte knowe his face that was bistad amonges alle the faces in that route:  so stant custance and loketh hir aboute. o quenes livinge in prosperitee duchesses and ye ladies everichone haveth som routhe on hir adversitee; an emperoures doghter stant allone;  she hath no wight to whom to make hir mone. o blood royal that stondest in this drede fer ben thy freendes at thy grete nede!  this alla king hath swich compassioun as gentil herte is fulfild of pitee  that from his yen ran the water doun. now hastily do fecche a book quod he and if this knight wol sweren how that she this womman slow yet wole we us avyse whom that we wole that shal ben our iustyse.  a briton book writen with evangyles was fet and on this book he swoor anoon she gilty was and in the mene whyles  a hand him smoot upon the nekkeboon that doun he fil atones as a stoon  and bothe his yen broste out of his face in sight of every body in that place. a vois was herd in general audience and seyde thou hast desclaundred giltelees the doghter of holy chirche in hey presence;  thus hastou doon and yet holde i my pees. of this mervaille agast was al the prees; as mased folk they stoden everichone  for drede of wreche save custance allone. greet was the drede and eek the repentance  of hem that hadden wrong suspeccioun upon this sely innocent custance; and for this miracle in conclusioun and by custances mediacioun the king and many another in that place  converted was thanked be cristes grace! this false knight was slayn for his untrouthe by iugement of alla hastifly;  and yet custance hadde of his deeth gret routhe. and after this iesus of his mercy  made alla wedden ful solempnely this holy mayden that is so bright and shene and thus hath crist ymaad custance a quene. but who was woful if i shal nat lye of this wedding but donegild and na mo  the kinges moder ful of tirannye? hir thoughte hir cursed herte brast atwo; she wolde noght hir sone had do so;  hir thoughte a despit that he sholde take so strange a creature unto his make.  me list nat of the chaf nor of the stree maken so long a tale as of the corn. what sholde i tellen of the royaltee at mariage or which cours gooth biforn who bloweth in a trompe or in an horn?  the fruit of every tale is for to seye; they ete and drinke and daunce and singe and pleye. they goon to bedde as it was skile and right;  for thogh that wyves been ful holy thinges they moste take in pacience at night  swich maner necessaries as been plesinges to folk that han ywedded hem with ringes and leye a lyte hir holinesse asyde as for the tyme; it may no bet bityde. on hir he gat a knavechild anoon  and to a bishop and his constable eke he took his wyf to kepe whan he is goon to scotlandward his fomen for to seke;  now faire custance that is so humble and meke so longe is goon with childe til that stille  she halt hir chambre abyding cristes wille. the tyme is come a knavechild she ber; mauricius at the fontstoon they him calle; this constable dooth forth come a messager and wroot unto his king that cleped was alle  how that this blisful tyding is bifalle and othere tydings speedful for to seye; he takth the lettre and forth he gooth his weye.  this messager to doon his avantage unto the kinges moder rydeth swythe  and salueth hir ful faire in his langage madame quod he ye may be glad and blythe and thanke god an hundred thousand sythe; my lady quene hath child withouten doute to ioye and blisse of al this regne aboute.  lo heer the lettres seled of this thing that i mot bere with al the haste i may; if ye wol aught unto your sone the king  i am your servant bothe night and day. donegild answerde as now at this tyme nay;  but heer al night i wol thou take thy reste tomorwe wol i seye thee what me leste. this messager drank sadly ale and wyn and stolen were his lettres prively out of his box whyl he sleep as a swyn;  and countrefeted was ful subtilly another lettre wroght ful sinfully unto the king direct of this matere  fro his constable as ye shul after here. the lettre spak the queen delivered was  of so horrible a feendly creature that in the castel noon so hardy was that any whyle dorste ther endure. the moder was an elf by aventure ycome by charmes or by sorcerye  and every wight hateth hir companye. wo was this king whan he this lettre had seyn but to no wighte he tolde his sorwes sore  but of his owene honde he wroot ageyn welcome the sonde of crist for evermore  to me that am now lerned in his lore;

but blisful marie heelp hir right anon;  for with hir strugling wel and mightily the theef fil over bord al sodeinly and in the see he dreynte for vengeance; and thus hath crist unwemmed kept custance. o foule lust of luxurie! lo thyn ende! auctor.  nat only that thou feyntest mannes minde but verraily thou wolt his body shende; thende of thy werk or of thy lustes blinde  is compleyning how manyoon may men finde that noght for werk somtyme but for thentente  to doon this sinne ben outher sleyn or shente! how may this wayke womman han this strengthe hir to defende agayn this renegat? o golias unmesurable of lengthe how mighte david make thee so mat  so yong and of armure so desolat? how dorste he loke upon thy dredful face? wel may men seen it nas but goddes grace!  who yaf iudith corage or hardinesse to sleen him olofernus in his tente  and to deliveren out of wrecchednesse the peple of god? i seye for this entente that right as god spirit of vigour sente to hem and saved hem out of meschance so sente he might and vigour to custance.  forth goth hir ship thurghout the narwe mouth of iubaltar and septe dryving ay somtyme west somtyme north and south  and somtyme est ful many a wery day til cristes moder blessed be she ay!  hath shapen thurgh hir endelees goodnesse to make an ende of al hir hevinesse. now lat us stinte of custance but a throwe and speke we of the romain emperour that out of surrie hath by lettres knowe  the slaughtre of cristen folk and dishonour don to his doghter by a fals traitour i mene the cursed wikked sowdanesse  that at the feste leet sleen both more and lesse. for which this emperour hath sent anoon  his senatour with royal ordinance and othere lordes got wot many oon on surriens to taken heigh vengeance. they brennen sleen and bringe hem to meschance ful many a day; but shortly this is thende  homward to rome they shapen hem to wende. this senatour repaireth with victorie to romeward sayling ful royally  and mette the ship dryving as seith the storie in which custance sit ful pitously.  nothing ne knew he what she was ne why she was in swich array; ne she nil seye of hir estaat althogh she sholde deye. he bringeth hir to rome and to his wyf he yaf hir and hir yonge sone also;  and with the senatour she ladde her lyf. thus can our lady bringen out of wo woful custance and many another mo.  and longe tyme dwelled she in that place in holy werkes ever as was hir grace.  the senatoures wyf hir aunte was but for al that she knew hir never the more; i wol no lenger tarien in this cas but to king alla which i spak of yore that for his wyf wepeth and syketh sore  i wol retourne and lete i wol custance under the senatoures governance. king alla which that hadde his moder slayn  upon a day fil in swich repentance that if i shortly tellen shal and plain  to rome he comth to receyven his penance; and putte him in the popes ordinance in heigh and low and iesu crist bisoghte foryeve his wikked werkes that he wroghte. the fame anon thurgh rome toun is born  how alla king shal come in pilgrimage by herbergeours that wenten him biforn; for which the senatour as was usage  rood him ageyn and many of his linage as wel to shewen his heighe magnificence  as to don any king a reverence. greet chere dooth this noble senatour to king alla and he to him also; everich of hem doth other greet honour; and so bifel that in a day or two  this senatour is to king alla go to feste and shortly if i shal nat lye custances sone wente in his companye.  som men wolde seyn at requeste of custance this senatour hath lad this child to feste;  i may nat tellen every circumstance be as be may ther was he at the leste. but soth is this that at his modres heste biforn alla during the metes space the child stood loking in the kinges face.  this alla king hath of this child greet wonder and to the senatour he seyde anon whos is that faire child that stondeth yonder?  i noot quod he by god and by seint iohn! a moder he hath but fader hath he non  that i of wootbut shortly in a stounde he tolde alla how that this child was founde. but god wot quod this senatour also so vertuous a livere in my lyf ne saugh i never as she ne herde of mo  of worldly wommen mayden nor of wyf; i dar wel seyn hir hadde lever a knyf thurghout her breste than been a womman wikke;  ther is no man coude bringe hir to that prikke. now was this child as lyk unto custance  as possible is a creature to be. this alla hath the face in remembrance of dame custance and theron mused he if that the childes moder were aught she that was his wyf and prively he sighte  and spedde him fro the table that he mighte. parfay thoghte he fantome is in myn heed! i oghte deme of skilful iugement  that in the salte see my wyf is deed. and afterward he made his argument  what woot i if that crist have hider ysent my wyf by see as wel as he hir sente to my contree fro thennes that she wente? and after noon hoom with the senatour goth alla for to seen this wonder chaunce.  this senatour dooth alla greet honour and hastifly he sente after custaunce. but trusteth weel hir liste nat to daunce  whan that she wiste wherefor was that sonde. unnethe upon hir feet she mighte stonde.  when alla saugh his wyf faire he hir grette and weep that it was routhe for to see. for at the firste look he on hir sette he knew wel verraily that it was she. and she for sorwe as domb stant as a tree;  so was hir herte shet in hir distresse whan she remembred his unkindenesse. twyes she swowned in his owne sighte;  he weep and him excuseth pitously: now god quod he and alle his halwes brighte  so wisly on my soule as have mercy that of your harm as giltelees am i as is maurice my sone so lyk your face; elles the feend me fecche out of this place! long was the sobbing and the bitter peyne  er that hir woful hertes mighte cesse; greet was the pitee for to here hem pleyne thurgh whiche pleintes gan hir wo encresse.  i prey yow al my labour to relesse; i may nat telle hir wo until tomorwe  i am so wery for to speke of sorwe. but fynally when that the sooth is wist that alla giltelees was of hir wo i trowe an hundred tymes been they kist and swich a blisse is ther bitwix hem two  that save the ioye that lasteth evermo ther is non lyk that any creature hath seyn or shal whyl that the world may dure.  tho preyde she hir housbond mekely in relief of hir longe pitous pyne  that he wold preye hir fader specially that of his magestee he wolde enclyne to vouchesauf som day with him to dyne; she preyde him eek he sholde by no weye unto hir fader no word of hir seye.  som men wold seyn how that the child maurice doth this message unto this emperour; but as i gesse alla was nat so nyce  to him that was of so sovereyn honour as he that is of cristen folk the flour  sente any child but it is bet to deme he wente himself and so it may wel seme. this emperour hath graunted gentilly to come to diner as he him bisoghte; and wel rede i he loked bisily  upon this child and on his doghter thoghte. alla goth to his in and as him oghte arrayed for this feste in every wyse  as ferforth as his conning may suffyse. the morwe cam and alla gan him dresse  and eek his wyf this emperour to mete; and forth they ryde in ioye and in gladnesse. and whan she saugh hir fader in the strete she lighte doun and falleth him to fete. fader quod she your yonge child custance  is now ful clene out of your remembrance. i am your doghter custance quod she that whylom ye han sent unto surrye.  it am i fader that in the salte see was put allone and dampned for to dye.  now gode fader mercy i yow crye send me namore unto non hethenesse but thonketh my lord heer of his kindenesse. who can the pitous ioye tellen al bitwix hem three sin they ben thus ymette?  but of my tale make an ende i shal; the day goth faste i wol no lenger lette. this glade folk to diner they hem sette;  in ioye and blisse at mete i lete hem dwelle a thousand fold wel more than i can telle.  this child maurice was sithen emperour maad by the pope and lived cristenly. to cristes chirche he dide greet honour; but i lete al his storie passen by of custance is my tale specially.  in olde romayn gestes may men finde maurices lyf; i bere it noght in minde. this king alla whan he his tyme sey  with his custance his holy wyf so swete to engelond been they come the righte wey  wheras they live in ioye and in quiete. but litel whyl it lasteth i yow hete ioye of this world for tyme wol nat abyde; fro day to night it changeth as the tyde. who lived ever in swich delyt o day  that him ne moeved outher conscience or ire or talent or som kin affray envye or pryde or passion or offence?  i ne seye but for this ende this sentence that litel whyl in ioye or in plesance  lasteth the blisse of alla with custance. for deeth that taketh of heigh and low his rente when passed was a yeer even as i gesse out of this world this king alla he hente for whom custance hath ful gret hevinesse.  now lat us preyen god his soule blesse! and dame custance; fynally to seye towards the toun of rome gooth hir weye.  to rome is come this holy creature and fyndeth ther hir frendes hole and sounde:  now is she scaped al hir aventure; and whan that she hir fader hath yfounde doun on hir knees falleth she to grounde; weping for tendrenesse in herte blythe she herieth god an hundred thousand sythe.  in vertu and in holy almesdede they liven alle and never asonder wende; til deeth departed hem this lyf they lede.  and fareth now weel my tale is at an ende. now iesu crist that of his might may sende  ioye after wo governe us in his grace and kepe us alle that ben in this place! amen. here endeth the tale of the man of lawe; and next folweth the shipmannes prolog. now freendes seide our hoost so dere how lyketh you by iohn the pardonere? for he hath unbokeled wel the male; he hath us told right a thrifty tale as touching of misgovernaunce i preye to god yeve him good chaunce! as ye han herd of thise riotoures three. now gentil mariner hertely i preye thee telle us a good tale and that right anon. it shall be doon by god and by seint iohn seyde this mariner as wel as ever i can and right anon his tale he bigan.  skeats notes on the shipmannes tale here biginneth the shipmannes prolog. our hoste upon his stiropes stood anon and seyde good men herkneth everich on; this was a thrifty tale for the nones!  sir parish prest quod he for goddes bones tel us a tale as was thy forward yore. i see wel that ye lerned men in lore can moche good by goddes dignitee! the persone him answerde benedicite!  what eyleth the man so sinfully to swere? our hoste answerde o iankin be ye there?  i smelle a loller in the wind quod he. how! good men quod our hoste herkneth me; abydeth for goddes digne passioun  for we shal han a predicacioun; this loller heer wil prechen us somwhat. nay by my fader soule! that shal be nat seyde the shipman; heer he shal nat preche he shal no gospel glosen heer ne teche.  we leve alle in the grete god quod he he wolde sowen som difficultee  or springen cokkel in our clene corn; and therfor hoste i warne thee biforn my ioly body shal a tale telle  and i shal clinken yow so mery a belle that i shal waken al this companye; but it shal nat ben of philosophye ne physices ne termes queinte of lawe;  ther is but litel latin in my mawe.  here endeth the shipman his prolog. here biginneth the shipmannes tale. a marchant whylom dwelled at seint denys that riche was for which men helde him wys; a wyf he hadde of excellent beautee and compaignable and revelous was she which is a thing that causeth more dispence  than worth is al the chere and reverence that men hem doon at festes and at daunces; swiche salutaciouns and contenaunces passen as dooth a shadwe upon the wal. but wo is him that payen moot for al;  the sely housbond algate he mot paye;  he moot us clothe and he moot us arraye al for his owene worship richely in which array we daunce iolily. and if that he noght may paraventure  or elles list no swich dispence endure but thinketh it is wasted and ylost than moot another payen for our cost or lene us gold and that is perilous. this noble marchant heeld a worthy hous  for which he hadde alday so greet repair  for his largesse and for his wyf was fair that wonder is; but herkneth to my tale. amonges alle his gestes grete and smale ther was a monk a fair man and a bold  i trowe of thritty winter he was old that ever in oon was drawing to that place. this yonge monk that was so fair of face aqueinted was so with the gode man sith that hir firste knoweliche bigan  that in his hous as famulier was he  as it possible is any freend to be. and for as muchel as this gode man and eek this monk of which that i bigan were bothe two yborn in o village  the monk him claimeth as for cosinage; and he again he seith nat ones nay but was as glad therof as fowel of day; for to his herte it was a greet plesaunce. thus been they knit with eterne alliaunce  and ech of hem gan other for tassure  of bretherhede whyl that hir lyf may dure. free was daun iohn and namely of dispence as in that hous; and ful of diligence to doon plesaunce and also greet costage.  he noght forgat to yeve the leeste page in al that hous; but after hir degree he yaf the lord and sitthe al his meynee when that he cam som maner honest thing; for which they were as glad of his coming  as fowel is fayn whan that the sonne upryseth.  na more of this as now for it suffyseth. but so bifel this marchant on a day shoop him to make redy his array toward the toun of brugges for to fare  to byen ther a porcioun of ware; for which he hath to paris sent anon a messager and preyed hath daun iohn that he sholde come to seint denys to pleye with him and with his wyf a day or tweye  er he to brugges wente in alle wyse.  this noble monk of which i yow devyse hath of his abbot as him list licence bycause he was a man of heigh prudence and eek an officer out for to ryde  to seen hir graunges and hir bernes wyde; and unto seint denys he comth anon. who was so welcome as my lord daun iohn our dere cosin ful of curteisye? with him broghte he a iubbe of malvesye  and eek another ful of fyn vernage  and volatyl as ay was his usage. and thus i lete hem ete and drinke and pleye this marchant and this monk a day or tweye. the thridde day this marchant up aryseth  and on his nedes sadly him avyseth and up into his countourhous goth he to rekene with himself as wel may be of thilke yeer how that it with him stood and how that he despended hadde his good;  and if that he encressed were or noon.  his bokes and his bagges many oon he leith biforn him on his countingbord; ful riche was his tresor and his hord for which ful faste his countourdore he shette;  and eek he nolde that no man sholde him lette of his accountes for the mene tyme; and thus he sit til it was passed pryme. daun iohn was risen in the morwe also and in the gardin walketh to and fro  and hath his thinges seyd ful curteisly.  this gode wyf cam walking prively into the gardin ther he walketh softe and him saleweth as she hath don ofte. a mayde child cam in hir companye  which as hir list she may governe and gye for yet under the yerde was the mayde. o dere cosin myn daun iohn she sayde what eyleth yow so rathe for to ryse? nece quod he it oghte ynough suffyse  fyve houres for to slepe upon a night  but it were for an old appalled wight as been thise wedded men that lye and dare as in a forme sit a wery hare were al forstraught with houndes grete and smale.  but dere nece why be ye so pale? i trowe certes that our gode man hath yow laboured sith the night bigan that yow were nede to resten hastily? and with that word he lough ful merily  and of his owene thought he wex al reed.  this faire wyf gan for to shake hir heed and seyde thus ye god wot al quod she; nay cosin myn it stant nat so with me. for by that god that yaf me soule and lyf  in al the reme of france is ther no wyf that lasse lust hath to that sory pley. for i may singe allas and weylawey that i was born but to no wight quod she dar i nat telle how that it stant with me.  wherfore i thinke out of this land to wende  or elles of myself to make an ende so ful am i of drede and eek of care. this monk bigan upon this wyf to stare and seyde allas my nece god forbede  that ye for any sorwe or any drede fordo yourself; but telleth me your grief; paraventure i may in your meschief conseille or helpe and therfore telleth me al your anoy for it shal been secree;  for on my porthors here i make an ooth  that never in my lyf for lief ne looth ne shal i of no conseil yow biwreye. the same agayn to yow quod she i seye; by god and by this porthors i yow swere  though men me wolde al into peces tere ne shal i never for to goon to helle biwreye a word of thing that ye me telle nat for no cosinage ne alliance but verraily for love and affiance.  thus been they sworn and heerupon they kiste  and ech of hem tolde other what hem liste. cosin quod she if that i hadde a space as i have noon and namely in this place than wolde i telle a legende of my lyf  what i have suffred sith i was a wyf with myn housbonde al be he your cosyn. nay quod this monk by god and seint martyn he is na more cosin unto me than is this leef that hangeth on the tree!  i clepe him so by seint denys of fraunce  to have the more cause of aqueintaunce of yow which i have loved specially aboven alle wommen sikerly; this swere i yow on my professioun.  telleth your grief lest that he come adoun and hasteth yow and gooth your wey anon. my dere love quod she o my daun iohn ful lief were me this conseil for to hyde but out it moot i may namore abyde.  myn housbond is to me the worste man  that ever was sith that the world bigan. but sith i am a wyf it sit nat me to tellen no wight of our privetee neither a bedde ne in non other place;  god shilde i sholde it tellen for his grace! a wyf ne shal nat seyn of hir housbonde but al honour as i can understonde; save unto yow thus muche i tellen shal; as help me god he is noght worth at al  in no degree the value of a flye.  but yet me greveth most his nigardye; and wel ye woot that wommen naturelly desyren thinges sixe as wel as i. they wolde that hir housbondes sholde be  hardy and wyse and riche and therto free and buxom to his wyf and fresh abedde. but by that ilke lord that for us bledde for his honour myself for to arraye a sonday next i moste nedes paye  an hundred frankes or elles am i lorn.  yet were me lever that i were unborn than me were doon a sclaundre or vileinye; and if myn housbond eek it mighte espye i nere but lost and therfore i yow preye  lene me this somme or elles moot i deye. daun iohn i seye lene me thise hundred frankes; pardee i wol nat faille yow my thankes if that yow list to doon that i yow praye. for at a certein day i wol yow paye  and doon to yow what plesance and servyce  that i may doon right as yow list devyse. and but i do god take on me vengeance as foul as ever had geniloun of france! this gentil monk answerde in this manere;  now trewely myn owene lady dere i have quod he on yow so greet a routhe that i yow swere and plighte yow my trouthe that whan your housbond is to flaundres fare i wol delivere yow out of this care;  for i wol bringe yow an hundred frankes.  and with that word he caughte hir by the flankes and hir embraceth harde and kiste hir ofte. goth now your wey quod he al stille and softe and lat us dyne as sone as that ye may;  for by my chilindre it is pryme of day. goth now and beeth as trewe as i shal be. now elles god forbede sire quod she and forth she gooth as iolif as a pye and bad the cokes that they sholde hem hye  so that men mighte dyne and that anon.  up to hir housbonde is this wyf ygon and knokketh at his countour boldely. qui la? quod he. peter! it am i quod she what sire how longe wol ye faste?  how longe tyme wol ye rekene and caste your sommes and your bokes and your thinges? the devel have part of alle swiche rekeninges! ye have ynough pardee of goddes sonde; come doun today and lat your bagges stonde.  ne be ye nat ashamed that daun iohn  shal fasting al this day elenge goon? what! lat us here a messe and go we dyne. wyf quod this man litel canstow devyne the curious bisinesse that we have.  for of us chapmen also god me save and by that lord that cleped is seint yve scarsly amonges twelve ten shul thryve continuelly lastinge unto our age. we may wel make chere and good visage  and dryve forth the world as it may be  and kepen our estaat in privetee til we be deed or elles that we pleye a pilgrimage or goon out of the weye. and therfor have i greet necessitee  upon this queinte world tavyse me; for evermore we mote stonde in drede of hap and fortune in our chapmanhede. to flaundres wol i go tomorwe at day and come agayn as sone as ever i may.  for which my dere wyf i thee biseke  as be to every wight buxom and meke and for to kepe our good be curious and honestly governe wel our hous. thou hast ynough in every maner wyse  that to a thrifty houshold may suffyse. thee lakketh noon array ne no vitaille of silver in thy purs shaltow nat faille. and with that word his countourdore he shette and doun he gooth no lenger wolde he lette  but hastily a messe was ther seyd  and spedily the tables were yleyd and to the diner faste they hem spedde; and richely this monk the chapman fedde. atafter diner daun iohn sobrely  this chapman took apart and prively he seyde him thus cosyn it standeth so that wel i see to brugges wol ye go. god and seint austin spede yow and gyde! i prey yow cosin wysly that ye ryde;  governeth yow also of your diete  atemprely and namely in this hete. bitwix us two nedeth no strange fare; farewel cosyn; god shilde yow fro care. if any thing ther be by day or night  if it lye in my power and my might that ye me wol comande in any wyse it shal be doon right as ye wol devyse. o thing er that ye goon if it may be i wolde prey yow; for to lene me  an hundred frankes for a wyke or tweye  for certein beestes that i moste beye to store with a place that is oures. god help me so i wolde it were youres! i shal nat faille surely of my day  nat for a thousand frankes a myleway. but lat this thing be secree i yow preye for yet tonight thise beestes moot i beye; and farenow wel myn owene cosin dere graunt mercy of your cost and of your chere.  this noble marchant gentilly anon  answerde and seyde o cosin myn daun iohn now sikerly this is a smal requeste; my gold is youres whan that it yow leste. and nat only my gold but my chaffare;

 after my might ful fayn wolde i yow plese. thise hundred frankes he fette forth anon and prively he took hem to daun iohn. no wight in al this world wiste of this lone  savinge this marchant and daun iohn allone. they drinke and speke and rome a whyle and pleye til that daun iohn rydeth to his abbeye. the morwe cam and forth this marchant rydeth to flaundresward; his prentis wel him gydeth  til he cam into brugges merily.  now gooth this marchant faste and bisily aboute his nede and byeth and creaunceth. he neither pleyeth at the dees ne daunceth; but as a marchant shortly for to telle  he let his lyf and there i lete him dwelle. the sonday next this marchant was agon to seint denys ycomen is daun iohn with crowne and berd all fresh and newe yshave. in al the hous ther nas so litel a knave  ne no wight elles that he nas ful fayn  for that my lord daun iohn was come agayn. and shortly to the point right for to gon this faire wyf accorded with daun iohn that for thise hundred frankes he sholde al night  have hir in his armes boltupright; and this acord parfourned was in dede. in mirthe al night a bisy lyf they lede til it was day that daun iohn wente his way and bad the meynee farewel have good day!  for noon of hem ne no wight in the toun  hath of daun iohn right no suspecioun. and forth he rydeth hoom to his abbeye or where him list; namore of him i seye. this marchant whan that ended was the faire  to seint denys he gan for to repaire and with his wyf he maketh feste and chere and telleth hir that chaffare is so dere that nedes moste he make a chevisaunce. for he was bounde in a reconissaunce  to paye twenty thousand sheeld anon.  for which this marchant is to paris gon to borwe of certein frendes that he hadde a certein frankes; and somme with him he ladde. and whan that he was come into the toun  for greet chertee and greet affeccioun unto daun iohn he gooth him first to pleye; nat for to axe or borwe of him moneye but for to wite and seen of his welfare and for to tellen him of his chaffare  as freendes doon whan they ben met yfere.  daun iohn him maketh feste and mery chere; and he him tolde agayn ful specially how he hadde wel yboght and graciously thanked be god al hool his marchandyse.  save that he moste in alle maner wyse maken a chevisaunce as for his beste and thanne he sholde been in ioye and reste. daun iohn answerde certes i am fayn that ye in hele ar comen hoom agayn.  and if that i were riche as have i blisse  of twenty thousand sheeld shold ye nat misse for ye so kindely this other day lente me gold;

 for he was riche and cleerly out of dette. whan it was day this marchant gan embrace his wyf al newe and kiste hir on hir face and up he gooth and maketh it ful tough. namore quod she by god ye have ynough!  and wantounly agayn with him she pleyde;  til atte laste that this marchant seyde by god quod he i am a litel wrooth with yow my wyf althogh it be me looth. and woot ye why? by god as that i gesse  that ye han maad a maner straungenesse bitwixen me and my cosyn daun iohn. ye sholde han warned me er i had gon that he yow hadde an hundred frankes payed by redy tokene; and heeld him yvel apayed  for that i to him spak of chevisaunce  me semed so as by his contenaunce. but nathelees by god our hevene king i thoghte nat to axe of him nothing. i prey thee wyf ne do namore so;  tel me alwey er that i fro thee go if any dettour hath in myn absence ypayed thee; lest thurgh thy necligence i mighte him axe a thing that he hath payed. this wyf was nat afered nor affrayed  but boldely she seyde and that anon:  marie i defye the false monk daun iohn! i kepe nat of hise tokenes never a deel; he took me certein gold that woot i weel! what! yvel thedom on his monkes snoute!  for god it woot i wende withouten doute that he had yeve it me bycause of yow to doon therwith myn honour and my prow for cosinage and eek for bele chere that he hath had ful ofte tymes here.  but sith i see i stonde in this disioint  i wol answere yow shortly to the point. ye han mo slakker dettours than am i! for i wol paye yow wel and redily fro day to day;

not that i may encresen hir honour; for she hirself is honour and the rote  of bountee next hir sone and soules bote. o moder mayde! o mayde moder free! o bush unbrent brenninge in moyses sighte that ravisedest doun fro the deitee thurgh thyn humblesse the goost that in thalighte  of whos vertu whan he thyn herte lighte conceived was the fadres sapience  help me to telle it in thy reverence! lady! thy bountee thy magnificence thy vertu and thy grete humilitee  ther may no tonge expresse in no science; for somtyme lady er men praye to thee thou goost biforn of thy benignitee and getest us the light thurgh thy preyere to gyden us unto thy sone so dere.  my conning is so wayk o blisful quene for to declare thy grete worthinesse  that i ne may the weighte nat sustene but as a child of twelf monthe old or lesse that can unnethes any word expresse  right so fare i and therfor i yow preye gydeth my song that i shal of yow seye. explicit. here biginneth the prioresses tale. ther was in asie in a greet citee amonges cristen folk a iewerye sustened by a lord of that contree  for foule usure and lucre of vilanye hateful to crist and to his companye;  and thurgh the strete men mighte ryde or wende for it was free and open at either ende. a litel scole of cristen folk ther stood  doun at the ferther ende in which ther were children an heep ycomen of cristen blood that lerned in that scole yeer by yere swich maner doctrine as men used there this is to seyn to singen and to rede  as smale children doon in hir childhede. among thise children was a widwes sone  a litel clergeon seven yeer of age that day by day to scole was his wone and eek also wheras he saugh thimage  of cristes moder hadde he in usage as him was taught to knele adoun and seye his ave marie as he goth by the weye. thus hath this widwe hir litel sone ytaught our blisful lady cristes moder dere  to worshipe ay and he forgat it naught for sely child wol alday sone lere;  but ay whan i remembre on this matere seint nicholas stant ever in my presence for he so yong to crist did reverence.  this litel child his litel book lerninge as he sat in the scole at his prymer he alma redemptoris herde singe as children lerned hir antiphoner; and as he dorste he drough him ner and ner  and herkned ay the wordes and the note til he the firste vers coude al by rote.  noght wiste he what this latin was to seye for he so yong and tendre was of age; but on a day his felaw gan he preye  texpounden him this song in his langage or telle him why this song was in usage; this preyde he him to construe and declare ful ofte tyme upon his knowes bare. his felaw which that elder was than he  answerde him thus: this song i have herd seye was maked of our blisful lady free  hir to salue and eek hir for to preye to been our help and socour whan we deye. i can no more expounde in this matere;  i lerne song i can but smal grammere. and is this song maked in reverence of cristes moder? seyde this innocent; now certes i wol do my diligence to conne it al er cristemasse is went;  though that i for my prymer shal be shent and shal be beten thryes in an houre  i wol it conne our lady for to honoure. his felaw taughte him homward prively fro day to day til he coude it by rote  and than he song it wel and boldely fro word to word acording with the note; twyes a day it passed thurgh his throte to scoleward and homward whan he wente; on cristes moder set was his entente.  as i have seyd thurghout the iewerye this litel child as he cam to and fro  ful merily than wolde he singe and crye o alma redemptoris evermo. the swetnes hath his herte perced so  of cristes moder that to hir to preye he can nat stinte of singing by the weye. our firste fo the serpent sathanas that hath in iewes herte his waspes nest up swal and seide o hebraik peple allas!  is this to yow a thing that is honest that swich a boy shal walken as him lest  in your despyt and singe of swich sentence which is agayn your lawes reverence? fro thennes forth the iewes han conspyred  this innocent out of this world to chace; an homicyde therto han they hyred that in an aley hadde a privee place; and as the child gan forby for to pace this cursed iew him hente and heeld him faste  and kitte his throte and in a pit him caste. i seye that in a wardrobe they him threwe  wheras these iewes purgen hir entraille. o cursed folk of herodes al newe what may your yvel entente yow availle?  mordre wol out certein it wol nat faille and namely ther thonour of god shal sprede the blood out cryeth on your cursed dede. o martir souded to virginitee now maystou singen folwing ever in oon  the whyte lamb celestial quod she of which the grete evangelist seint iohn  in pathmos wroot which seith that they that goon biforn this lamb and singe a song al newe that never fleshly wommen they ne knewe.  this povre widwe awaiteth al that night after hir litel child but he cam noght; for which as sone as it was dayes light with face pale of drede and bisy thoght she hath at scole and elleswher him soght  til finally she gan so fer espye that he last seyn was in the iewerye.  with modres pitee in hir brest enclosed she gooth as she were half out of hir minde to every place wher she hath supposed  by lyklihede hir litel child to finde; and ever on cristes moder meke and kinde she cryde and atte laste thus she wroghte among the cursed iewes she him soghte. she frayneth and she preyeth pitously  to every iew that dwelte in thilke place to telle hir if hir child wente oght forby.  they seyde nay; but iesu of his grace yaf in hir thought inwith a litel space that in that place after hir sone she cryde  wher he was casten in a pit bisyde. o grete god that parfournest thy laude by mouth of innocents lo heer thy might! this gemme of chastitee this emeraude and eek of martirdom the ruby bright  ther he with throte ycorven lay upright he alma redemptoris gan to singe  so loude that al the place gan to ringe. the cristen folk that thurgh the strete wente in coomen for to wondre upon this thing  and hastily they for the provost sente; he cam anon withouten tarying and herieth crist that is of heven king and eek his moder honour of mankinde and after that the iewes leet he binde  this child with pitous lamentacioun uptaken was singing his song alway;  and with honour of greet processioun they carien him unto the nexte abbay. his moder swowning by the bere lay;  unnethe might the peple that was there this newe rachel bringe fro his bere. with torment and with shamful deth echon this provost dooth thise iewes for to sterve that of this mordre wiste and that anon;  he nolde no swich cursednesse observe. yvel shal have that yvel wol deserve.  therfor with wilde hors he dide hem drawe and after that he heng hem by the lawe. upon his here ay lyth this innocent  biforn the chief auter whyl masse laste and after that the abbot with his covent han sped hem for to burien him ful faste; and whan they holy water on him caste yet spak this child whan spreynd was holy water  and songo alma redemptoris mater! this abbot which that was an holy man  as monkes been or elles oghten be this yonge child to coniure he bigan and seyde o dere child i halse thee  in vertu of the holy trinitee tel me what is thy cause for to singe sith that thy throte is cut to my seminge? my throte is cut unto my nekkeboon seyde this child and as by wey of kinde  i sholde have deyed ye longe tyme agoon but iesu crist as ye in bokes finde  wil that his glorie laste and be in minde and for the worship of his moder dere yet may i singe o alma loude and clere.  this welle of mercy cristes moder swete i lovede alwey as after my conninge; and whan that i my lyf sholde forlete to me she cam and bad me for to singe this antem verraily in my deyinge  as ye han herd and whan that i had songe me thoughte she leyde a greyn upon my tonge.  wherfor i singe and singe i moot certeyn in honour of that blisful mayden free til fro my tonge oftaken is the greyn;  and afterward thus seyde she to me my litel child now wol i fecche thee whan that the greyn is fro thy tonge ytake; be nat agast i wol thee nat forsake. this holy monk this abbot him mene i  his tonge outcaughte and took awey the greyn and he yaf up the goost ful softely.  and whan this abbot had this wonder seyn his salte teres trikled doun as reyn and gruf he fil al plat upon the grounde  and stille he lay as he had been ybounde. the covent eek lay on the pavement weping and herien cristes moder dere and after that they ryse and forth ben went and toke awey this martir fro his bere  and in a tombe of marbulstones clere enclosen they his litel body swete;  ther he is now god leve us for to mete. o yonge hugh of lincoln slayn also with cursed iewes as it is notable  for it nis but a litel whyle ago; preye eek for us we sinful folk unstable that of his mercy god so merciable on us his grete mercy multiplye  for reverence of his moder marye. amen.  here is ended the prioresses tale. bihold the murye wordes of the host to chaucer. whan seyd was al this miracle every man as sobre was that wonder was to se til that our hoste iapen tho bigan and than at erst he loked upon me and seyde thus what man artow? quod he;  thou lokest as thou woldest finde an hare for ever upon the ground i see thee stare. approche neer and loke up merily. now war yow sirs and lat this man have place; he in the waast is shape as wel as i;  this were a popet in an arm tenbrace  for any womman smal and fair of face. he semeth elvish by his contenaunce for unto no wight dooth he daliaunce. sey now somwhat sin other folk han sayd;  tel us a tale of mirthe and that anoon; hoste quod i ne beth nat yvel apayd for other tale certes can i noon but of a ryme i lerned longe agoon. ye that is good quod he; now shul we here  som deyntee thing me thinketh by his chere.  explicit. here biginneth chaucers tale of thopas. listeth lordes in good entent and i wol telle verrayment of mirthe and of solas; al of a knyght was fair and gent  in bataille and in tourneyment his name was sir thopas. yborn he was in fer contree in flaundres al biyonde the see at popering in the place;  his fader was a man ful free  and lord he was of that contree as it was goddes grace. sir thopas wex a doghty swayn whyt was his face as payndemayn  his lippes rede as rose; his rode is lyk scarlet in grayn and i yow telle in good certayn he hadde a semely nose. his heer his berd was lyk saffroun  that to his girdel raughte adoun;  his shoon of cordewane. of brugges were his hosen broun his robe was of ciclatoun that coste many a iane.  he coude hunte at wilde deer and ryde an hauking for riveer with grey goshauk on honde; therto be was a good archeer of wrastling was ther noon his peer  ther any ram shal stonde.  ful many a mayde bright in bour they moorne for him paramour whan hem were bet to slepe; but he was chast and no lechour  and sweet as is the brembleflour that bereth the rede hepe. and so bifel upon a day for sothe as i yow telle may sir thopas wolde out ryde;  he worth upon his stede gray  and in his honde a launcegay a long swerd by his syde. he priketh thurgh a fair forest therinne is many a wilde best  ye bothe bukke and hare; and as he priketh north and est i telle it yow him hadde almest bitid a sory care. ther springen herbes grete and smale  the lycorys and cetewale  and many a clowegilofre; and notemuge to putte in ale whether it be moyste or stale or for to leye in cofre.  the briddes singe it is no nay the sparhauk and the papeiay that ioye it was to here; the thrustelcok made eek his lay the wodedowve upon the spray  she sang ful loude and clere.  sir thopas fil in lovelonginge al whan he herde the thrustel singe and priked as he were wood: his faire stede in his prikinge  so swatte that men mighte him wringe his sydes were al blood. sir thopas eek so wery was for prikinge on the softe gras so fiers was his corage  that doun he leyde him in that plas  to make his stede som solas and yaf him good forage. o seinte marie benedicite! what eyleth this love at me  to binde me so sore? me dremed al this night pardee an elfqueen shal my lemman be and slepe under my gore. an elfqueen wol i love ywis  for in this world no womman is  worthy to be my make t.  in toune; t.  alle othere wommen i forsake t.  and to an elfqueen i me take  by dale and eek by doune! into his sadel he clamb anoon and priketh over style and stoon an elfqueen for tespye til he so longe had riden and goon  that he fond in a privee woon  the contree of fairye t.  so wilde; t.  for in that contree was ther noon that to him dorste ryde or goon  neither wyf ne childe. til that ther cam a greet geaunt his name was sir olifaunt a perilous man of dede; he seyde child by termagaunt  butif thou prike out of myn haunt  anon i slee thy stede t.  with mace. t.  heer is the queen of fayerye with harpe and pype and simphonye  dwelling in this place. the child seyde also mote i thee tomorwe wol i mete thee whan i have myn armoure; and yet i hope par ma fay  that thou shalt with this launcegay  abyen it ful soure; t.  thy mawe t.  shal i percen if i may er it be fully pryme of day  for heer thou shalt be slawe. sir thopas drow abak ful faste; this geaunt at him stones caste out of a fel stafslinge; but faire escapeth child thopas  and al it was thurgh goddes gras  and thurgh his fair beringe. yet listeth lordes to my tale merier than the nightingale for now i wol yow roune  how sir thopas with sydes smale priking over hil and dale is come agayn to toune. his merie men comanded he to make him bothe game and glee  for nedes moste he fighte  with a geaunt with hevedes three for paramour and iolitee of oon that shoon ful brighte. do come he seyde my minstrales  and gestours for to tellen tales anon in myn arminge; of romances that been royales of popes and of cardinales and eek of lovelykinge.  they fette him first the swete wyn  and mede eek in a maselyn and royal spicerye of gingebreed that was ful fyn and lycorys and eek comyn  with sugre that is so trye. he dide next his whyte lere of clooth of lake fyn and clere a breech and eek a sherte; and next his sherte an aketoun  and over that an habergeoun  for percinge of his herte; and over that a fyn hauberk was al ywroght of iewes werk ful strong it was of plate;  and over that his cotearmour as whyt as is a lilyflour in which he wol debate. his sheeld was al of gold so reed and therin was a bores heed  a charbocle bisyde;  and there he swoor on ale and breed how that the geaunt shal be deed bityde what bityde! his iambeux were of quirboilly  his swerdes shethe of yvory his helm of laton bright; his sadel was of rewelboon his brydel as the sonne shoon or as the mone light.  his spere was of fyn ciprees  that bodeth werre and nothing pees the heed ful sharpe ygrounde; his stede was al dappelgray it gooth an ambel in the way  ful softely and rounde t.  in londe. t.  lo lordes myne heer is a fit! if ye wol any more of it to telle it wol i fonde.  the second fit. now hold your mouth par charitee  bothe knight and lady free and herkneth to my spelle; of bataille and of chivalry and of ladyes lovedrury  anon i wol yow telle. men speke of romances of prys of horn child and of ypotys of bevis and sir gy of sir libeux and pleyndamour;  but sir thopas he bereth the flour  of royal chivalry. his gode stede al he bistrood and forth upon his wey he glood as sparkle out of the bronde;  upon his crest he bar a tour and therin stiked a lilyflour god shilde his cors fro shonde! and for he was a knight auntrous he nolde slepen in non hous  but liggen in his hode;  his brighte helm was his wonger and by him baiteth his dextrer of herbes fyne and gode. himself drank water of the wel  as did the knight sir percivel so worthy under wede til on a day  here the host stinteth chaucer of his tale of thopas. no more of this for goddes dignitee quod oure hoste for thou makest me  so wery of thy verray lewednesse that also wisly god my soule blesse myn eres aken of thy drasty speche; now swiche a rym the devel i biteche! this may wel be rym dogerel quod he.  why so? quod i why wiltow lette me more of my tale than another man sin that it is the beste rym i can?  by god quod he for pleynly at a word thy drasty ryming is nat worth a tord;  thou doost nought elles but despendest tyme sir at o word thou shall no lenger ryme. lat see wher thou canst tellen aught in geste or telle in prose somwhat at the leste in which ther be som mirthe or som doctryne.  gladly quod i by goddes swete pyne i wol yow telle a litel thing in prose that oghte lyken yow as i suppose  or elles certes ye been to daungerous. it is a moral tale vertuous  al be it told somtyme in sondry wyse of sondry folk as i shal yow devyse. as thus; ye woot that every evangelist that telleth us the peyne of iesu crist ne saith nat al thing as his felaw dooth  but natheles hir sentence is al sooth and alle acorden as in hir sentence al be ther in hir telling difference.  for somme of hem seyn more and somme lesse whan they his pitous passioun expresse;  i mene of marke mathew luk and iohn; but doutelees hir sentence is al oon. therfor lordinges alle i yow biseche if that ye thinke i varie as in my speche as thus thogh that i telle somwhat more  of proverbes than ye han herd bifore comprehended in this litel tretis here to enforce with the theffect of my matere  and thogh i nat the same wordes seye as ye han herd yet to yow alle i preye  blameth me nat; for as in my sentence ye shul not fynden moche difference fro the sentence of this tretis lyte after the which this mery tale i wryte. and therfor herkneth what that i shal seye  and lat me tellen al my tale i preye.  explicit. here biginneth chaucers tale of melibee.  . a yong man called melibeus mighty and riche bigat upon his wyf that called was prudence a doghter which that called was sophie.   . upon a day bifel that he for his desport is went into the feeldes him to pleye.  his wyf and eek his doghter hath he left inwith his hous of which the dores weren fast yshette.  thre of his olde foos han it espyed and setten laddres to the walles of his hous and by the windowes been entred  and betten his wyf and wounded his doghter with fyve mortal woundes in fyve sondry places;  this is to seyn in hir feet in hir handes in hir eres in hir nose and in hir mouth; and leften hir for deed and wenten awey.   . whan melibeus retourned was into his hous and saugh al this meschief he lyk a mad man rendinge his clothes gan to wepe and crye.   . prudence his wyf as ferforth as she dorste bisoghte him of his weping for to stinte;  but nat forthy he gan to crye and wepen ever lenger the more.   . this noble wyf prudence remembered hir upon the sentence of ovide in his book that cleped is the remedie of love wheras he seith;  he is a fool that destourbeth the moder to wepen in the deeth of hir child til she have wept hir fille as for a certain tyme;  and thanne shal man doon his diligence with amiable wordes hir to reconforte and preyen hir of hir weping for to stinte.  for which resoun this noble wyf prudence suffred hir housbond for to wepe and crye as for a certein space;  and whan she saugh hir tyme she seyde him in this wyse. allas my lord quod she why make ye yourself for to be lyk a fool?  for sothe it aperteneth nat to a wys man to maken swiche a sorwe.  your doghter with the grace of god shal warisshe and escape.  and al were it so that she right now were deed ye ne oghte nat as for hir deeth yourself to destroye.  senek seith: the wise man shal nat take to greet disconfort for the deeth of his children  but certes he sholde suffren it in pacience as wel as he abydeth the deeth of his owene propre persone.   . this melibeus answerde anon and seyde what man quod he sholde of his weping stinte that hath so greet a cause for to wepe?  iesu crist our lord himself wepte for the deeth of lazarus his freend.  prudence answerde certes wel i woot attempree weping is nothing defended to him that sorweful is amonges folk in sorwe but it is rather graunted him to wepe.  the apostle paul unto the romayns wryteth man shal reioyse with hem that maken ioye and wepen with swich folk as wepen.  but thogh attempree weping be ygraunted outrageous weping certes is defended.  mesure of weping sholde be considered after the lore that techeth us senek.  whan that thy freend is deed quod he lat nat thyne eyen to moyste been of teres ne to muche drye; althogh the teres come to thyne eyen lat hem nat falle.  and whan thou hast forgoon thy freend do diligence to gete another freend; and this is more wysdom than for to wepe for thy freend which that thou hast lorn; for therinne is no bote.  and therfore if ye governe yow by sapience put awey sorwe out of your herte.  remembre yow that iesus syrak seith: a man that is ioyous and glad in herte it him conserveth florisshing in his age; but soothly sorweful herte maketh his bones drye.  he seith eek thus: that sorwe in herte sleeth ful many a man.  salomon seith: that right as motthes in the shepes flees anoyeth to the clothes and the smale wormes to the tree right so anoyeth sorwe to the herte.  wherfore us oghte as wel in the deeth of our children as in the losse of our goodes temporels have pacience.   . remembre yow upon the pacient iob whan he hadde lost his children and his temporel substance and in his body endured and receyved ful many a grevous tribulacioun; yet seyde he thus:  our lord hath yeven it me our lord hath biraft it me; right as our lord hath wold right so it is doon; blessed be the name of our lord.  to thise foreseide thinges answerde melibeus unto his wyf prudence: alle thy wordes quod he been sothe and therto profitable; but trewely myn herte is troubled with this sorwe so grevously that i noot what to done.  lat calle quod prudence thy trewe freendes alle and thy linage whiche that been wyse; telleth your cas and herkneth what they seye in conseiling and yow governe after hir sentence.  salomon seith: werk alle thy thinges by conseil and thou shalt never repente.   . thanne by the conseil of his wyf prudence this melibeus leet callen a greet congregacioun of folk;  as surgiens phisiciens olde folk and yonge and somme of hise olde enemys reconsiled as by hir semblaunt to his love and into his grace;  and therwithal ther comen somme of hise neighebores that diden him reverence more for drede than for love as it happeth ofte.  ther comen also ful many subtile flatereres and wyse advocats lerned in the lawe.   . and whan this folk togidre assembled weren this melibeus in sorweful wyse shewed hem his cas;  and by the manere of his speche it semed that in herte he bar a cruel ire redy to doon vengeaunce upon hise foos and sodeynly desired that the werre sholde biginne;  but nathelees yet axed he hir conseil upon this matere.  a surgien by licence and assent of swiche as weren wyse up roos and unto melibeus seyde as ye may here.   . sir quod he as to us surgiens aperteneth that we do to every wight the beste that we can wheras we been withholde and to our pacients that we do no damage;  wherfore it happeth many tyme and ofte that whan twey men han everich wounded other oon same surgien heleth hem bothe;  wherefore unto our art it is nat pertinent to norice werre ne parties to supporte.  but certes as to the warisshinge of your doghter albeit so that she perilously be wounded we shullen do so ententif bisinesse fro day to night that with the grace of god she shal be hool and sound as sone as is possible.  almost right in the same wyse the phisiciens answerden save that they seyden a fewe wordes more:  that right as maladyes been cured by hir contraries right so shul men warisshe werre by vengeaunce.  his neighebores ful of envye his feyned freendes that semeden reconsiled and his flatereres  maden semblant of weping and empeireden and agreggeden muchel of this matere in preising greetly melibee of might of power of richesse and of freendes despysinge the power of his adversaries  and seiden outrely that he anon sholde wreken him on his foos and biginne werre.   . up roos thanne an advocat that was wys by leve and by conseil of othere that were wyse and seyde:  lordinges the nede for which we been assembled in this place is a ful hevy thing and an heigh matere  bycause of the wrong and of the wikkednesse that hath be doon and eek by resoun of the grete damages that in tyme cominge been possible to fallen for this same cause;  and eek by resoun of the grete richesse and power of the parties bothe;  for the whiche resouns it were a ful greet peril to erren in this matere.  wherfore melibeus this is our sentence: we conseille yow aboven alle thing that right anon thou do thy diligence in kepinge of thy propre persone in swich a wyse that thou ne wante noon espye ne wacche thy body for to save.  and after that we conseille that in thyn hous thou sette suffisant garnisoun so that they may as wel thy body as thyn hous defende.  but certes for to moeve werre or sodeynly for to doon vengeaunce we may nat demen in so litel tyme that it were profitable.  wherfore we axen leyser and espace to have deliberacioun in this cas to deme.  for the commune proverbe seith thus: he that sone demeth sone shal repente.  and eek men seyn that thilke iuge is wys that sone understondeth a matere and iuggeth by leyser.  for albeit so that alle tarying be anoyful algates it is nat to repreve in yevinge of iugement ne in vengeancetaking whan it is suffisant and resonable.  and that shewed our lord iesu crist by ensample; for whan that the womman that was taken in avoutrie was broght in his presence to knowen what sholde be doon with hir persone albeit so that he wiste wel himself what that he wolde answere yet ne wolde he nat answere sodeynly but he wolde have deliberacioun and in the ground he wroot twyes.  and by thise causes we axen deliberacioun and we shal thanne by the grace of god conseille thee thing that shal be profitable.   . up stirten thanne the yonge folk atones and the moste partie of that companye han scorned the olde wyse men and bigonnen to make noyse and seyden: that  right so as whyl that iren is hoot men sholden smyte right so men sholde wreken hir wronges whyle that they been fresshe and newe; and with loud voys they cryden werre! werre!  up roos tho oon of thise olde wyse and with his hand made contenaunce that men sholde holden hem stille and yeven him audience.  lordinges quod he ther is ful many a man that cryeth werre! werre! that woot ful litel what werre amounteth.  werre at his biginning hath so greet an entree and so large that every wight may entre whan him lyketh and lightly finde werre.  but certes what ende that shal therof bifalle it is nat light to knowe.  for sothly whan that werre is ones bigonne ther is ful many a child unborn of his moder that shal sterve yong bycause of that ilke werre or elles live in sorwe and dye in wrecchednesse.  and therfore er that any werre biginne men moste have greet conseil and greet deliberacioun.  and whan this olde man wende to enforcen his tale by resons wel ny alle atones bigonne they to ryse for to breken his tale and beden him ful ofte his wordes for to abregge.  for soothly he that precheth to hem that listen nat heren his wordes his sermon hem anoyeth.  for iesus syrak seith: that musik in wepinge is anoyous thing; this is to seyn: as muche availleth to speken bifore folk to whiche his speche anoyeth as dooth to singe biforn him that wepeth.  and whan this wyse man saugh that him wanted audience al shamefast he sette him doun agayn.  for salomon seith: theras thou ne mayst have noon audience enforce thee nat to speke.  i see wel quod this wyse man that the commune proverbe is sooth; that good conseil wanteth whan it is most nede.   . yet hadde this melibeus in his conseil many folk that prively in his ere conseilled him certeyn thing and conseilled him the contrarie in general audience.  whan melibeus hadde herd that the gretteste partie of his conseil weren accorded that he sholde maken werre anoon he consented to hir conseilling and fully affermed hir sentence.  thanne dame prudence whan that she saugh how that hir housbonde shoop him for to wreken him on his foos and to biginne werre she in ful humble wyse when she saugh hir tyme seide him thise wordes:  my lord quod she i yow biseche as hertely as i dar and can ne haste yow nat to faste and for alle guerdons as yeveth me audience.  for piers alfonce seith: whoso that dooth to that other good or harm haste thee nat to quyten it; for in this wyse thy freend wol abyde and thyn enemy shal the lenger live in drede.  the proverbe seith: he hasteth wel that wysely can abyde; and in wikked haste is no profit.   . this melibee answerde unto his wyf prudence: i purpose nat quod he to werke by thy conseil for many causes and resouns. for certes every wight wolde holde me thanne a fool;  this is to seyn if i for thy conseilling wolde chaungen thinges that been ordeyned and affermed by so manye wyse.  secoundly i seye that alle wommen been wikke and noon good of hem alle. for of a thousand men seith salomon i fond a good man: but certes of alle wommen good womman fond i never.  and also certes if i governed me by thy conseil it sholde seme that i hadde yeve to thee over me the maistrie; and god forbede that it so were.  for iesus syrak seith; that if the wyf have maistrie she is contrarious to hir housbonde.  and salomon seith: never in thy lyf to thy wyf ne to thy child ne to thy freend ne yeve no power over thyself. for bettre it were that thy children aske of thy persone thinges that hem nedeth than thou see thyself in the handes of thy children.  and also if i wolde werke by thy conseilling certes my conseilling moste som tyme be secree til it were tyme that it moste be knowe; and this ne may noght be.  for it is writen that the ianglerie of wommen can hyden thinges that they witen noght.  furthermore the philosophre seith in wikked conseil wommen venquisshe men; and for thise resouns i ne ow nat usen thy conseil.   . whanne dame prudence ful debonairly and with greet pacience hadde herd al that hir housbonde lyked for to seye thanne axed she of him licence for to speke and seyde in this wyse.  my lord quod she as to your firste resoun certes it may lightly been answered. for i seye that it is no folie to chaunge conseil whan the thing is chaunged; or elles whan the thing semeth otherweyes than it was biforn.  and moreover i seye that though ye han sworn and bihight to perfourne your emprise and nathelees ye weyve to perfourne thilke same emprise by iuste cause men sholde nat seyn therefore that ye were a lyer ne forsworn.  for the book seith that the wyse man maketh no lesing whan he turneth his corage to the bettre.  and albeit so that your emprise be establissed and ordeyned by greet multitude of folk yet thar ye nat accomplice thilke same ordinaunce but yow lyke.  for the trouthe of thinges and the profit been rather founden in fewe folk that been wyse and ful of resoun than by greet multitude of folk ther every man cryeth and clatereth what that him lyketh. soothly swich multitude is nat honeste.  as to the seconde resoun whereas ye seyn that alle wommen been wikke save your grace certes ye despysen alle wommen in this wyse; and he that alle despyseth alle displeseth as seith the book.  and senek seith that whoso wole have sapience shal no man dispreise; but he shal gladly techen the science that he can withouten presumpcioun or pryde.  and swiche thinges as he nought ne can he shal nat been ashamed to lerne hem and enquere of lasse folk than himself.  and sir that ther hath been many a good womman may lightly be preved.  for certes sir our lord iesu crist wolde never have descended to be born of a womman if alle wommen hadden ben wikke.  and after that for the grete bountee that is in wommen our lord iesu crist whan he was risen fro deeth to lyve appeered rather to a womman than to his apostles.  and though that salomon seith that he ne fond never womman good it folweth nat therfore that alle wommen ben wikke.  for though that he ne fond no good womman certes ful many another man hath founden many a womman ful good and trewe.  or elles peraventure the entente of salomon was this; that as in sovereyn bountee he fond no womman;  this is to seyn that ther is no wight that hath sovereyn bountee save god allone; as he himself recordeth in his evaungelie.  for ther nis no creature so good that him ne wanteth somwhat of the perfeccioun of god that is his maker.  your thridde resoun is this: ye seyn that if ye governe yow by my conseil it sholde seme that ye hadde yeve me the maistrie and the lordshipe over your persone.  sir save your grace it is nat so. for if it were so that no man sholde be conseilled but only of hem that hadden lordshipe and maistrie of his persone men wolden nat be conseilled so ofte.  for soothly thilke man that asketh conseil of a purpos yet hath he free chois wheither he wole werke by that conseil or noon.  and as to your fourthe resoun ther ye seyn that the ianglerie of wommen hath hid thinges that they woot noght as who seith that a womman can nat hyde that she woot;  sir thise wordes been understonde of wommen that been iangleresses and wikked;  of whiche wommen men seyn that three thinges dryven a man out of his hous; that is to seyn smoke dropping of reyn and wikked wyves;  and of swiche wommen seith salomon that it were bettre dwelle in desert than with a womman that is riotous.  and sir by your leve that am nat i;  for ye han ful ofte assayed my grete silence and my gret pacience; and eek how wel that i can hyde and hele thinges that men oghte secreely to hyde.  and soothly as to your fifthe resoun wheras ye seyn that in wikked conseil wommen venquisshe men; god woot thilke resoun stant here in no stede.  for understand now ye asken conseil to do wikkednesse;  and if ye wole werken wikkednesse and your wyf restreyneth thilke wikked purpos and overcometh yow by resoun and by good conseil;  certes your wyf oghte rather to be preised than yblamed.  thus sholde ye understonde the philosophre that seith in wikked conseil wommen venquisshen hir housbondes.  and theras ye blamen alle wommen and hir resouns i shal shewe yow by manye ensamples that many a womman hath ben ful good and yet been; and hir conseils ful hoolsome and profitable.  eek som men han seyd that the conseillinge of wommen is outher to dere or elles to litel of prys.  but albeit so that ful many a womman is badde and hir conseil vile and noght worth yet han men founde ful many a good womman and ful discrete and wise in conseillinge.  lo iacob by good conseil of his moder rebekka wan the benisoun of ysaak his fader and the lordshipe over alle his bretheren.  iudith by hir good conseil delivered the citee of bethulie in which she dwelled out of the handes of olofernus that hadde it biseged and wolde have al destroyed it.  abigail delivered nabal hir housbonde fro david the king that wolde have slayn him and apaysed the ire of the king by hir wit and by hir good conseilling.  hester by hir good conseil enhaunced greetly the peple of god in the regne of assuerus the king.  and the same bountee in good conseilling of many a good womman may men telle.  and moreover whan our lord hadde creat adam our formefader he seyde in this wyse:  it is nat good to been a man allone; make we to him an help semblable to himself.  here may ye se that if that wommen were nat goode and hir conseils goode and profitable  our lord god of hevene wolde never han wroght hem ne called hem help of man but rather confusioun of man.  and ther seyde ones a clerk in two vers: what is bettre than gold? iaspre. what is bettre than iaspre? wisdom.  and what is bettre than wisdom? womman. and what is bettre than a good womman? nothing.  and sir by manye of othre resons may ye seen that manye wommen been goode and hir conseils goode and profitable.  and therfore sir if ye wol triste to my conseil i shal restore yow your doghter hool and sound.  and eek i wol do to yow so muche that ye shul have honour in this cause.   . whan melibee hadde herd the wordes of his wyf prudence he seyde thus:  i see wel that the word of salomon is sooth; he seith that wordes that been spoken discreetly by ordinaunce been honycombes; for they yeven swetnesse to the soule and hoolsomnesse to the body.  and wyf bycause of thy swete wordes and eek for i have assayed and preved thy grete sapience and thy grete trouthe i wol governe me by thy conseil in alle thing.   . now sir quod dame prudence and sin ye vouchesauf to been governed by my conseil i wol enforme yow how ye shul governe yourself in chesinge of your conseillours.  ye shul first in alle your werkes mekely biseken to the heighe god that he wol be your conseillour;  and shapeth yow to swich entente that he yeve yow conseil and confort as taughte thobie his sone.  at alle tymes thou shalt blesse god and praye him to dresse thy weyes; and looke that alle thy conseils been in him for evermore.  seint iame eek seith: if any of yow have nede of sapience axe it of god.  and afterward thanne shul ye taken conseil in yourself and examine wel your thoghtes of swich thing as yow thinketh that is best for your profit.  and thanne shul ye dryve fro your herte three thinges that been contrariouse to good conseil  that is to seyn ire coveitise and hastifnesse.   . first he that axeth conseil of himself certes he moste been withouten ire for manye causes.  the firste is this: he that hath greet ire and wratthe in himself he weneth alwey that he may do thing that he may nat do.  and secoundely he that is irous and wroth he ne may nat wel deme;  and he that may nat wel deme may nat wel conseille.  the thridde is this; that he that is irous and wrooth as seith senek ne may nat speke but he blame thinges;  and with his viciouse wordes he stireth other folk to angre and to ire.  and eek sir ye moste dryve coveitise out of your herte.  for the apostle seith that coveitise is rote of alle harmes.  and trust wel that a coveitous man ne can noght deme ne thinke but only to fulfille the ende of his coveitise;  and certes that ne may never been accompliced; for ever the more habundaunce that he hath of richesse the more he desyreth.  and sir ye moste also dryve out of your herte hastifnesse; for certes  ye ne may nat deme for the beste a sodeyn thought that falleth in youre herte but ye moste avyse yow on it ful ofte.  for as ye herde biforn the commune proverbe is this that he that sone demeth sone repenteth.   . sir ye ne be nat alwey in lyke disposicioun;  for certes som thing that somtyme semeth to yow that it is good for to do another tyme it semeth to yow the contrarie.   . whan ye han taken conseil in yourself and han demed by good deliberacion swich thing as you semeth best  thanne rede i yow that ye kepe it secree.  biwrey nat your conseil to no persone butif so be that ye wenen sikerly that thurgh your biwreying your condicioun shal be to yow the more profitable.  for iesus syrak seith: neither to thy foo ne to thy freend discovere nat thy secree ne thy folie;  for they wol yeve yow audience and loking and supportacioun in thy presence and scorne thee in thyn absence.  another clerk seith that scarsly shaltou finden any persone that may kepe conseil secreely.  the book seith: whyl that thou kepest thy conseil in thyn herte thou kepest it in thy prisoun:  and whan thou biwreyest thy conseil to any wight he holdeth thee in his snare.  and therefore yow is bettre to hyde your conseil in your herte than praye him to whom ye han biwreyed your conseil that he wole kepen it cloos and stille.  for seneca seith: if so be that thou ne mayst nat thyn owene conseil hyde how darstou prayen any other wight thy conseil secreely to kepe?  but nathelees if thou wene sikerly that the biwreying of thy conseil to a persone wol make thy condicioun to stonden in the bettre plyt thanne shaltou tellen him thy conseil in this wyse.  first thou shalt make no semblant whether thee were lever pees or werre or this or that ne shewe him nat thy wille and thyn entente;  for trust wel that comunly thise conseillours been flatereres  namely the conseillours of grete lordes;  for they enforcen hem alwey rather to speken plesante wordes enclyninge to the lordes lust than wordes that been trewe or profitable.  and therfore men seyn that the riche man hath seld good conseil butif he have it of himself.  and after that thou shalt considere thy freendes and thyne enemys.  and as touchinge thy freendes thou shalt considere whiche of hem been most feithful and most wyse and eldest and most approved in conseilling.  and of hem shalt thou aske thy conseil as the caas requireth.   . i seye that first ye shul clepe to your conseil your freendes that been trewe.  for salomon seith: that right as the herte of a man delyteth in savour that is sote right so the conseil of trewe freendes yeveth swetenesse to the soule.  he seith also: ther may nothing be lykned to the trewe freend.  for certes gold ne silver beth nat so muche worth as the gode wil of a trewe freend.  and eek he seith that a trewe freend is a strong deffense; whoso that it findeth certes he findeth a greet tresour.  thanne shul ye eek considere if that your trewe freendes been discrete and wyse. for the book seith: axe alwey thy conseil of hem that been wyse.  and by this same resoun shul ye clepen to your conseil of your freendes that been of age swiche as han seyn and been expert in manye thinges and been approved in conseillinges.  for the book seith that in olde men is the sapience and in longe tyme the prudence.  and tullius seith: that grete thinges ne been nat ay accompliced by strengthe ne by delivernesse of body but by good conseil by auctoritee of persones and by science; the whiche three thinges ne been nat feble by age but certes they enforcen and encreesen day by day.  and thanne shul ye kepe this for a general reule. first shul ye clepen to your conseil a fewe of your freendes that been especiale;  for salomon seith: manye freendes have thou; but among a thousand chese thee oon to be thy conseillour.  for albeit so that thou first ne telle thy conseil but to a fewe thou mayst afterward telle it to mo folk if it be nede.  but loke alwey that thy conseillours have thilke three condiciouns that i have seyd bifore; that is to seyn that they be trewe wyse and of old experience.  and werke nat alwey in every nede by oon counseillour allone; for somtyme bihoveth it to been conseilled by manye.  for salomon seith: salvacioun of thinges is wheras ther been manye conseillours.   . now sith that i have told yow of which folk ye sholde been counseilled now wol i teche yow which conseil ye oghte to eschewe.  first ye shul eschewe the conseilling of foles; for salomon seith: taak no conseil of a fool for he ne can noght conseille but after his owene lust and his affeccioun.  the book seith: that the propretee of a fool is this; he troweth lightly harm of every wight and lightly troweth alle bountee in himself.  thou shalt eek eschewe the conseilling of alle flatereres swiche as enforcen hem rather to preise your persone by flaterye than for to telle yow the sothfastnesse of thinges.   . wherfore tullius seith: amonges alle the pestilences that been in freendshipe the gretteste is flaterye. and therfore is it more nede that thou eschewe and drede flatereres than any other peple.  the book seith: thou shalt rather drede and flee fro the swete wordes of flateringe preiseres than fro the egre wordes of thy freend that seith thee thy sothes.  salomon seith that the wordes of a flaterere is a snare to cacche with innocents.  he seith also that he that speketh to his freend wordes of swetnesse and of plesaunce setteth a net biforn his feet to cacche him.  and therfore seith tullius: enclyne nat thyne eres to flatereres ne taketh no conseil of wordes of flaterye.  and caton seith: avyse thee wel and eschewe the wordes of swetnesse and of plesaunce.  and eek thou shalt eschewe the conseilling of thyne olde enemys that been reconsiled.  the book seith: that no wight retourneth saufly into the grace of his olde enemy.  and isope seith: ne trust nat to hem to whiche thou hast had somtyme werre or enmitee ne telle hem nat thy conseil.  and seneca telleth the cause why. it may nat be seith he that where greet fyr hath longe tyme endured that ther ne dwelleth som vapour of warmnesse.  and therfore seith salomon: in thyn olde foo trust never.  for sikerly though thyn enemy be reconsiled and maketh thee chere of humilitee and louteth to thee with his heed ne trust him never.  for certes he maketh thilke feyned humilitee more for his profit than for any love of thy persone; bycause that he demeth to have victorie over thy persone by swich feyned contenance the which victorie he mighte nat have by stryf or werre.  and peter alfonce seith: make no felawshipe with thyne olde enemys; for if thou do hem bountee they wol perverten it into wikkednesse.  and eek thou most eschewe the conseilling of hem that been thy servants and beren thee greet reverence; for peraventure they seyn it more for drede than for love.  and therfore seith a philosophre in this wyse: ther is no wight parfitly trewe to him that he to sore dredeth.  and tullius seith: ther nis no might so greet of any emperour that longe may endure butif he have more love of the peple than drede.  thou shalt also eschewe the conseiling of folk that been dronkelewe; for they ne can no conseil hyde.  for salomon seith: ther is no privetee theras regneth dronkenesse.  ye shul also han in suspect the conseilling of swich folk as conseille yow a thing prively and conseille yow the contrarie openly.  for cassidorie seith: that it is a maner sleighte to hindre whan he sheweth to doon a thing openly and werketh prively the contrarie.  thou shalt also have in suspect the conseilling of wikked folk. for the book seith: the conseilling of wikked folk is alwey ful of fraude:  and david seith: blisful is that man that hath nat folwed the conseilling of shrewes.  thou shalt also eschewe the conseilling of yong folk; for hir conseil is nat rype.   . now sir sith i have shewed yow of which folk ye shul take your conseil and of which folk ye shul folwe the conseil  now wol i teche yow how ye shal examine your conseil after the doctrine of tullius.  in the examininge thanne of your conseillour ye shul considere manye thinges.  alderfirst thou shalt considere that in thilke thing that thou purposest and upon what thing thou wolt have conseil that verray trouthe be seyd and conserved; this is to seyn telle trewely thy tale.  for he that seith fals may nat wel be conseilled in that cas of which he lyeth.  and after this thou shalt considere the thinges that acorden to that thou purposest for to do by thy conseillours if resoun accorde therto;  and eek if thy might may atteine therto; and if the more part and the bettre part of thy conseillours acorde therto or no.  thanne shaltou considere what thing shal folwe of that conseilling; as hate pees werre grace profit or damage; and manye othere thinges.  and in alle thise thinges thou shalt chese the beste and weyve alle othere thinges.  thanne shaltow considere of what rote is engendred the matere of thy conseil and what fruit it may conceyve and engendre.  thou shalt eek considere alle thise causes fro whennes they been sprongen.  and whan ye han examined your conseil as i have seyd and which partie is the bettre and more profitable and hast approved it by manye wyse folk and olde;  thanne shaltou considere if thou mayst parfourne it and maken of it a good ende.  for certes resoun wol nat that any man sholde biginne a thing butif he mighte parfourne it as him oghte.  ne no wight sholde take upon hym so hevy a charge that he mighte nat bere it.  for the proverbe seith: he that to muche embraceth distreyneth litel.  and catoun seith: assay to do swich thing as thou hast power to doon lest that the charge oppresse thee so sore that thee bihoveth to weyve thing that thou hast bigonne.  and if so be that thou be in doute whether thou mayst parfourne a thing or noon chese rather to suffre than biginne.  and piers alphonce seith: if thou hast might to doon a thing of which thou most repente thee it is bettre nay than ye;  this is to seyn that thee is bettre holde thy tonge stille than for to speke.  thanne may ye understonde by strenger resons that if thou hast power to parfourne a werk of which thou shalt repente thanne is it bettre that thou suffre than biginne.  wel seyn they that defenden every wight to assaye any thing of which he is in doute whether he may parfourne it or no.  and after whan ye han examined your conseil as i have seyd biforn and knowen wel that ye may parfourne youre emprise conferme it thanne sadly til it be at an ende.   . now is it resoun and tyme that i shewe yow whanne and wherfore that ye may chaunge your conseil withouten your repreve.  soothly a man may chaungen his purpos and his conseil if the cause cesseth or whan a newe caas bitydeth.  for the lawe seith: that upon thinges that newely bityden bihoveth newe conseil.  and senek seith: if thy conseil is comen to the eres of thyn enemy chaunge thy conseil.  thou mayst also chaunge thy conseil if so be that thou finde that by errour or by other cause harm or damage may bityde.  also if thy conseil be dishonest or elles cometh of dishoneste cause chaunge thy conseil.  for the lawes seyn: that alle bihestes that been dishoneste been of no value.  and eek if it so be that it be inpossible or may nat goodly be parfourned or kept.   . and take this for a general reule that every conseil that is affermed so strongly that it may nat be chaunged for no condicioun that may bityde i seye that thilke conseil is wikked.   . this melibeus whanne he hadde herd the doctrine of his wyf dame prudence answerde in this wyse.  dame quod he as yet into this tyme ye han wel and covenably taught me as in general how i shal governe me in the chesinge and in the withholdinge of my conseillours.  but now wolde i fayn that ye wolde condescende in especial  and telle me how lyketh yow or what semeth yow by our conseillours that we han chosen in our present nede.   . my lord quod she i biseke yow in al humblesse that ye wol nat wilfully replye agayn my resouns ne distempre your herte thogh i speke thing that yow displese.  for god wot that as in myn entente i speke it for your beste for your honour and for your profite eke.  and soothly i hope that your benignitee wol taken it in pacience.  trusteth me wel quod she that your conseil as in this caas ne sholde nat as to speke properly be called a conseilling but a mocioun or a moevyng of folye;  in which conseil ye han erred in many a sondry wyse.   . first and forward ye han erred in thassemblinge of your conseillours.  for ye sholde first have cleped a fewe folk to your conseil and after ye mighte han shewed it to mo folk if it hadde been nede.  but certes ye han sodeynly cleped to your conseil a greet multitude of peple ful chargeant and ful anoyous for to here.  also ye han erred for thereas ye sholden only have cleped to your conseil your trewe freendes olde and wyse  ye han ycleped straunge folk and yong folk false flatereres and enemys reconsiled and folk that doon yow reverence withouten love.  and eek also ye have erred for ye han broght with yow to your conseil ire covetise and hastifnesse;  the whiche three thinges been contrariouse to every conseil honeste and profitable;  the whiche three thinges ye han nat anientissed or destroyed hem neither in yourself ne in your conseillours as yow oghte.  ye han erred also for ye han shewed to your conseillours your talent and your affeccioun to make werre anon and for to do vengeance;  they han espyed by your wordes to what thing ye been enclyned.  and therfore han they rather conseilled yow to your talent than to your profit.  ye han erred also for it semeth that yow suffyseth to han been conseilled by thise conseillours only and with litel avys;  wheras in so greet and so heigh a nede it hadde been necessarie mo conseillours and more deliberacioun to parfourne your emprise.  ye han erred also for ye han nat examined your conseil in the forseyde manere ne in due manere as the caas requireth.  ye han erred also for ye han maked no divisioun bitwixe your conseillours; this is to seyn bitwixen your trewe freendes and your feyned conseillours;  ne ye han nat knowe the wil of your trewe freendes olde and wyse;  but ye han cast alle hir wordes in an hochepot and enclyned your herte to the more part and to the gretter nombre; and ther been ye condescended.  and sith ye wot wel that men shal alwey finde a gretter nombre of foles than of wyse men  and therfore the conseils that been at congregaciouns and multitudes of folk theras men take more reward to the nombre than to the sapience of persones  ye see wel that in swiche conseillinges foles han the maistrie.  melibeus answerde agayn and seyde: i graunte wel that i have erred;  but theras thou hast told me heerbiforn that he nis nat to blame that chaungeth hise conseillours in certein caas and for certeine iuste causes  i am al redy to chaunge my conseillours right as thow wolt devyse.  the proverbe seith: that for to do sinne is mannish but certes for to persevere longe in sinne is werk of the devel.   . to this sentence answerde anon dame prudence and seyde:  examineth quod she your conseil and lat us see the whiche of hem han spoken most resonably and taught yow best conseil.  and forasmuche as that the examinacioun is necessarie lat us biginne at the surgiens and at the phisiciens that first speken in this matere.  i sey yow that the surgiens and phisiciens han seyd yow in your conseil discreetly as hem oughte;  and in hir speche seyden ful wysly that to the office of hem aperteneth to doon to every wight honour and profit and no wight for to anoye;  and after hir craft to doon greet diligence unto the cure of hem whiche that they han in hir governaunce.  and sir right as they han answered wysly and discreetly  right so rede i that they been heighly and sovereynly guerdoned for hir noble speche;  and eek for they sholde do the more ententif bisinesse in the curacioun of your doghter dere.  for albeit so that they been your freendes therfore shal ye nat suffren that they serve yow for noght;  but ye oghte the rather guerdone hem and shewe hem your largesse.  and as touchinge the proposicioun which that the phisiciens entreteden in this caas this is to seyn  that in maladyes that oon contrarie is warisshed by another contrarie  i wolde fayn knowe how ye understonde thilke text and what is your sentence.  certes quod melibeus i understonde it in this wyse:  that right as they han doon me a contrarie right so sholde i doon hem another.  for right as they han venged hem on me and doon me wrong right so shal i venge me upon hem and doon hem wrong;  and thanne have i cured oon contrarie by another.   . lo lo! quod dame prudence how lightly is every man enclyned to his owene desyr and to his owene plesaunce!  certes quod she the wordes of the phisiciens ne sholde nat han been understonden in this wyse.  for certes wikkednesse is nat contrarie to wikkednesse ne vengeaunce to vengeaunce ne wrong to wrong; but they been semblable.  and therfore o vengeaunce is nat warisshed by another vengeaunce ne o wrong by another wrong;  but everich of hem encreesceth and aggreggeth other.  but certes the wordes of the phisiciens sholde been understonden in this wyse:  for good and wikkednesse been two contraries and pees and werre vengeaunce and suffraunce discord and accord and manye othere thinges.  but certes wikkednesse shal be warisshed by goodnesse discord by accord werre by pees and so forth of othere thinges.  and heerto accordeth seint paul the apostle in manye places.  he seith: ne yeldeth nat harm for harm ne wikked speche for wikked speche;  but do wel to him that dooth thee harm and blesse him that seith to thee harm.  and in manye othere places he amonesteth pees and accord.  but now wol i speke to yow of the conseil which that was yeven to yow by the men of lawe and the wyse folk  that seyden alle by oon accord as ye han herd bifore;  that over alle thynges ye sholde doon your diligence to kepen your persone and to warnestore your hous.  and seyden also that in this caas ye oghten for to werken ful avysely and with greet deliberacioun.  and sir as to the firste point that toucheth to the keping of your persone;  ye shul understonde that he that hath werre shal evermore mekely and devoutly preyen biforn alle thinges  that iesus crist of his grete mercy wol han him in his proteccioun and been his sovereyn helping at his nede.  for certes in this world ther is no wight that may be conseilled ne kept suffisantly withouten the keping of our lord iesu crist.  to this sentence accordeth the prophete david that seith:  if god ne kepe the citee in ydel waketh he that it kepeth.  now sir thanne shul ye committe the keping of your persone to your trewe freendes that been approved and yknowe;  and of hem shul ye axen help your persone for to kepe. for catoun seith: if thou hast nede of help axe it of thy freendes;  for ther nis noon so good a phisicien as thy trewe freend.  and after this thanne shul ye kepe yow fro alle straunge folk and fro lyeres and have alwey in suspect hir companye.  for piers alfonce seith: ne tak no companye by the weye of a straunge man butif so be that thou have knowe him of a lenger tyme.  and if so be that he falle into thy companye paraventure withouten thyn assent  enquere thanne as subtilly as thou mayst of his conversacioun and of his lyf bifore and feyne thy wey; seye that thou goost thider as thou wolt nat go;  and if he bereth a spere hold thee on the right syde and if he bere a swerd hold thee on the lift syde.  and after this thanne shul ye kepe yow wysely from alle swich manere peple as i have seyd bifore and hem and hir conseil eschewe.  and after this thanne shul ye kepe yow in swich manere  that for any presumpcioun of your strengthe that ye ne dispyse nat ne acounte nat the might of your adversarie so litel that ye lete the keping of your persone for your presumpcioun;  for every wys man dredeth his enemy.  and salomon seith: weleful is he that of alle hath drede;  for certes he that thurgh the hardinesse of his herte and thurgh the hardinesse of himself hath to greet presumpcioun him shal yvel bityde.  thanne shul ye evermore countrewayte embusshements and alle espiaille.  for senek seith: that the wyse man that dredeth harmes escheweth harmes;  ne he ne falleth into perils that perils escheweth.  and albeit so that it seme that thou art in siker place yet shaltow alwey do thy diligence in kepinge of thy persone;  this is to seyn ne be nat necligent to kepe thy persone nat only fro thy gretteste enemys but fro thy leeste enemy.  senek seith: a man that is wel avysed he dredeth his leste enemy.  ovide seith: that the litel wesele wol slee the grete bole and the wilde hert.  and the book seith: a litel thorn may prikke a greet king ful sore; and an hound wol holde the wilde boor.  but nathelees i sey nat thou shall be so coward that thou doute ther wheras is no drede.  the book seith: that somme folk han greet lust to deceyve but yet they dreden hem to be deceyved.  yet shaltou drede to been empoisoned and kepe yow from the companye of scorneres.  for the book seith: with scorneres make no companye but flee hir wordes as venim.   . now as to the seconde point wheras your wyse conseillours conseilled yow to warnestore your hous with gret diligence  i wolde fayn knowe how that ye understonde thilke wordes and what is your sentence.   . melibeus answerde and seyde certes i understande it in this wise; that i shal warnestore myn hous with toures swiche as han castelles and othere manere edifices and armure and artelleries  by whiche thinges i may my persone and myn hous so kepen and defenden that myne enemys shul been in drede myn hous for to approche.   . to this sentence answerde anon prudence; warnestoring quod she of heighe toures and of grete edifices apperteneth somtyme to pryde;  and eek men make heighe toures and grete edifices with grete costages and with greet travaille; and whan that they been accompliced yet be they nat worth a stree butif they be defended by trewe freendes that been olde and wyse.  and understond wel that the gretteste and strongeste garnison that a riche man may have as wel to kepen his persone as hise goodes is  that he be biloved amonges his subgets and with hise neighebores.  for thus seith tullius: that ther is a maner garnison that no man may venquisse ne disconfite and that is  a lord to be biloved of hise citezeins and of his peple.   . now sir as to the thridde point; wheras your olde and wise conseillours seyden that yow ne oghte nat sodeynly ne hastily proceden in this nede  but that yow oghte purveyen and apparaillen yow in this caas with greet diligence and greet deliberacioun;  trewely i trowe that they seyden right wysly and right sooth.  for tullius seith in every nede er thou biginne it apparaille thee with greet diligence.  thanne seye i that in vengeancetaking in werre in bataille and in warnestoring  er thow biginne i rede that thou apparaille thee therto and do it with greet deliberacioun.  for tullius seith: that long apparailling biforn the bataille maketh short victorie.  and cassidorus seith: the garnison is stronger whan it is longe tyme avysed.   . but now lat us speken of the conseil that was accorded by your neighebores swiche as doon yow reverence withouten love  your olde enemys reconsiled your flatereres  that conseilled yow certeyne thinges prively and openly conseilleden yow the contrarie;  the yonge folk also that conseilleden yow to venge yow and make werre anon.  and certes sir as i have seyd biforn ye han greetly erred to han cleped swich maner folk to your conseil;  which conseillours been ynogh repreved by the resouns aforeseyd.  but nathelees lat us now descende to the special. ye shuln first procede after the doctrine of tullius.  certes the trouthe of this matere or of this conseil nedeth nat diligently enquere;  for it is wel wist whiche they been that han doon to yow this trespas and vileinye  and how manye trespassours and in what manere they han to yow doon al this wrong and al this vileinye.  and after this thanne shul ye examine the seconde condicioun which that the same tullius addeth in this matere.  for tullius put a thing which that he clepeth consentinge this is to seyn;  who been they and how manye and whiche been they that consenteden to thy conseil in thy wilfulnesse to doon hastif vengeance.  and lat us considere also who been they and how manye been they and whiche been they that consenteden to your adversaries.  and certes as to the firste poynt it is wel knowen whiche folk been they that consenteden to your hastif wilfulnesse;  for trewely alle tho that conseilleden yow to maken sodeyn werre ne been nat your freendes.  lat us now considere whiche been they that ye holde so greetly your freendes as to your persone.  for albeit so that ye be mighty and riche certes ye ne been nat but allone.  for certes ye ne han no child but a doghter;  ne ye ne han bretheren ne cosins germayns ne noon other neigh kinrede  wherfore that your enemys for drede sholde stinte to plede with yow or to destroye your persone.  ye knowen also that your richesses moten been dispended in diverse parties;  and whan that every wight hath his part they ne wollen taken but litel reward to venge thy deeth.  but thyne enemys been three and they han manie children bretheren cosins and other ny kinrede;  and though so were that thou haddest slayn of hem two or three yet dwellen ther ynowe to wreken hir deeth and to slee thy persone.  and though so be that your kinrede be more siker and stedefast than the kin of your adversarie  yet nathelees your kinrede nis but a fer kinrede; they been but litel sib to yow  and the kin of your enemys been ny sib to hem. and certes as in that hir condicioun is bet than youres.  thanne lat us considere also if the conseilling of hem that conseilleden yow to taken sodeyn vengeaunce whether it accorde to resoun?  and certes ye knowe wel nay.  for as by right and resoun ther may no man taken vengeance on no wight but the iuge that hath the iurisdiccioun of it  whan it is graunted him to take thilke vengeance hastily or attemprely as the lawe requireth.  and yet moreover of thilke word that tullius clepeth consentinge  thou shalt considere if thy might and thy power may consenten and suffyse to thy wilfulnesse and to thy conseillours.  and certes thou mayst wel seyn that nay.  for sikerly as for to speke proprely we may do nothing but only swich thing as we may doon rightfully.  and certes rightfully ne mowe ye take no vengeance as of your propre auctoritee.  thanne mowe ye seen that your power ne consenteth nat ne accordeth nat with your wilfulnesse.  lat us now examine the thridde point that tullius clepeth consequent.  thou shalt understonde that the vengeance that thou purposest for to take is the consequent.  and therof folweth another vengeaunce peril and werre; and othere damages withoute nombre of whiche we be nat war as at this tyme.  and as touchinge the fourthe point that tullius clepeth engendringe  thou shalt considere that this wrong which that is doon to thee is engendred of the hate of thyne enemys;  and of the vengeancetakinge upon that wolde engendre another vengeance and muchel sorwe and wastinge of richesses as i seyde.   . now sir as to the point that tullius clepeth causes which that is the laste point  thou shall understonde that the wrong that thou hast receyved hath certeine causes  whiche that clerkes clepen oriens and efficiens and causa longinqua and causa propinqua; this is to seyn the fer cause and the ny cause.  the fer cause is almighty god that is cause of alle thinges.  the neer cause is thy three enemys.  the cause accidental was hate.  the cause material been the fyve woundes of thy doghter.  the cause formal is the manere of hir werkinge that broghten laddres and cloumben in at thy windowes.  the cause final was for to slee thy doghter; it letted nat in as muche as in hem was.  but for to speken of the fer cause as to what ende they shul come or what shal finally bityde of hem in this caas ne can i nat deme but by coniectinge and by supposinge.  for we shul suppose that they shul come to a wikked ende  bycause that the book of decrees seith: selden or with greet peyne been causes ybroght to good ende whanne they been baddely bigonne.   . now sir if men wolde axe me why that god suffred men to do yow this vileinye certes i can nat wel answere as for no sothfastnesse.  for thapostle seith that the sciences and the iuggementz of our lord god almighty been ful depe;  ther may no man comprehende ne serchen hem suffisantly.  nathelees by certeyne presumpcions and coniectinges i holde and bileve  that god which that is ful of iustice and of rightwisnesse hath suffred this bityde by iuste cause resonable.   . thy name is melibee this is to seyn a man that drinketh hony.  thou hast ydronke so muchel hony of swete temporel richesses and delices and honours of this world  that thou art dronken; and hast forgeten iesu crist thy creatour;  thou ne hast nat doon to him swich honour and reverence as thee oughte.  ne thou ne hast nat wel ytaken kepe to the wordes of ovide that seith:  under the hony of the godes of the body is hid the venim that sleeth the soule.  and salomon seith if thou hast founden hony ete of it that suffyseth;  for if thou ete of it out of mesure thou shalt spewe and be nedy and povre.  and peraventure crist hath thee in despit and hath turned awey fro thee his face and hise eres of misericorde;  and also he hath suffred that thou hast been punisshed in the manere that thow hast ytrespassed.  thou hast doon sinne agayn our lord crist;  for certes the three enemys of mankinde that is to seyn the flessh the feend and the world  thou hast suffred hem entre into thyn herte wilfully by the windowes of thy body  and hast nat defended thyself suffisantly agayns hir assautes and hir temptaciouns so that they han wounded thy soule in fyve places;  this is to seyn the deedly sinnes that been entred into thyn herte by thy fyve wittes.  and in the same manere our lord crist hath wold and suffred that thy three enemys been entred into thyn hous by the windowes  and han ywounded thy doghter in the foreseyde manere.   . certes quod melibee i see wel that ye enforce yow muchel by wordes to overcome me in swich manere that i shal nat venge me of myne enemys;  shewinge me the perils and the yveles that mighten falle of this vengeance.  but whoso wolde considere in alle vengeances the perils and yveles that mighte sewe of vengeancetakinge  a man wolde never take vengeance and that were harm;  for by the vengeancetakinge been the wikked men dissevered fro the gode men.  and they that han wil to do wikkednesse restreyne hir wikked purpos whan they seen the punissinge and chastysinge of the trespassours.  and to this answerde dame prudence: certes seyde she i graunte wel that of vengeaunce cometh muchel yvel and muchel good;  but vengeauncetaking aperteneth nat unto everichoon but only unto iuges and unto hem that han iurisdiccioun upon the trespassours.  and yet seye i more that right as a singuler persone sinneth in takinge vengeance of another man  right so sinneth the iuge if he do no vengeance of hem that it han deserved.  for senek seith thus: that maister he seith is good that proveth shrewes.  and as cassidore seith: a man dredeth to do outrages whan he woot and knoweth that it displeseth to the iuges and sovereyns.  and another seith: the iuge that dredeth to do right maketh men shrewes.  and seint paule the apostle seith in his epistle whan he wryteth unto the romayns: that the iuges beren nat the spere withouten cause;  but they beren it to punisse the shrewes and misdoeres and for to defende the gode men.  if ye wol thanne take vengeance of your enemys ye shul retourne or have your recours to the iuge that hath the iurisdiccion upon hem;  and he shal punisse hem as the lawe axeth and requyreth.   . a! quod melibee this vengeance lyketh me nothing.  i bithenke me now and take hede how fortune hath norissed me fro my childhede and hath holpen me to passe many a strong pas.  now wol i assayen hir trowinge with goddes help that she shal helpe me my shame for to venge.   . certes quod prudence if ye wol werke by my conseil ye shul nat assaye fortune by no wey;  ne ye shul nat lene or bowe unto hir after the word of senek:  for thinges that been folily doon and that been in hope of fortune shullen never come to good ende.  and as the same senek seith: the more cleer and the more shyning that fortune is the more brotil and the sonner broken she is.  trusteth nat in hir for she nis nat stidefast ne stable;  for whan thow trowest to be most seur or siker of hir help she wol faille thee and deceyve thee.  and wheras ye seyn that fortune hath norissed yow fro your childhede  i seye that in so muchel shul ye the lasse truste in hir and in hir wit.  for senek seith: what man that is norissed by fortune she maketh him a greet fool.  now thanne sin ye desyre and axe vengeance and the vengeance that is doon after the lawe and bifore the iuge ne lyketh yow nat  and the vengeance that is doon in hope of fortune is perilous and uncertein  thanne have ye noon other remedie but for to have your recours unto the sovereyn iuge that vengeth alle vileinyes and wronges;  and he shal venge yow after that himself witnesseth wheras he seith:  leveth the vengeance to me and i shal do it.   . melibee answerde if i ne venge me nat of the vileinye that men han doon to me  i sompne or warne hem that han doon to me that vileinye and alle othere to do me another vileinye.  for it is writen: if thou take no vengeance of an old vileinye thou sompnest thyne adversaries to do thee a newe vileinye.  and also for my suffrance men wolden do to me so muchel vileinye that i mighte neither here it ne sustene;  and so sholde i been put and holden over lowe.  for men seyn: in muchel suffringe shul manye thinges falle unto thee whiche thou shalt nat mowe suffre.   . certes quod prudence i graunte yow that over muchel suffraunce nis nat good;  but yet ne folweth it nat therof that every persone to whom men doon vileinye take of it vengeance;  for that aperteneth and longeth al only to the iuges for they shul venge the vileinyes and iniuries.  and therfore tho two auctoritees that ye han seyd above been only understonden in the iuges;  for whan they suffren over muchel the wronges and the vileinyes to be doon withouten punisshinge  they sompne nat a man al only for to do newe wronges but they comanden it.  also a wys man seith: that the iuge that correcteth nat the sinnere comandeth and biddeth him do sinne.  and the iuges and sovereyns mighten in hir land so muchel suffre of the shrewes and misdoeres  that they sholden by swich suffrance by proces of tyme wexen of swich power and might that they sholden putte out the iuges and the sovereyns from hir places  and atte laste maken hem lesen hir lordshipes.   . but lat us now putte that ye have leve to venge yow.  i seye ye been nat of might and power as now to venge yow.  for if ye wole maken comparisoun unto the might of your adversaries ye shul finde in manye thinges that i have shewed yow er this that hir condicioun is bettre than youres.  and therfore seye i that it is good as now that ye suffre and be pacient.   . forthermore ye knowen wel that after the comune sawe it is a woodnesse a man to stryve with a strenger or a more mighty man than he is himself;  and for to stryve with a man of evene strengthe that is to seyn with as strong a man as he it is peril;  and for to stryve with a weyker man it is folie.  and therfore sholde a man flee stryvinge as muchel as he mighte.  for salomon seith: it is a greet worship to a man to kepen him fro noyse and stryf.  and if it so bifalle or happe that a man of gretter might and strengthe than thou art do thee grevaunce  studie and bisie thee rather to stille the same grevaunce than for to venge thee.  for senek seith: that he putteth him in greet peril that stryveth with a gretter man than he is himself.  and catoun seith: if a man of hyer estaat or degree or more mighty than thou do thee anoy or grevaunce suffre him;  for he that ones hath greved thee may another tyme releve thee and helpe.  yet sette i caas ye have bothe might and licence for to venge yow.  i seye that ther be ful manye thinges that shul restreyne yow of vengeancetakinge  and make yow for to enclyne to suffre and for to han pacience in the thinges that han been doon to yow.  first and foreward if ye wole considere the defautes that been in your owene persone  for whiche defautes god hath suffred yow have this tribulacioun as i have seyd yow heerbiforn.  for the poete seith that we oghte paciently taken the tribulacions that comen to us whan we thinken and consideren that we han deserved to have hem.  and seint gregorie seith: that whan a man considereth wel the nombre of hise defautes and of his sinnes  the peynes and the tribulaciouns that he suffreth semen the lesse unto hym;  and inasmuche as him thinketh hise sinnes more hevy and grevous  insomuche semeth his peyne the lighter and the esier unto him.  also ye owen to enclyne and bowe your herte to take the pacience of our lord iesu crist as seith seint peter in hise epistles:  iesu crist he seith hath suffred for us and yeven ensample to every man to folwe and sewe him;  for he dide never sinne ne never cam ther a vileinous word out of his mouth:  whan men cursed him he cursed hem noght; and whan men betten him he manaced hem noght.  also the grete pacience which the seintes that been in paradys han had in tribulaciouns that they han ysuffred withouten hir desert or gilt  oghte muchel stiren yow to pacience.  forthermore ye sholde enforce yow to have pacience  consideringe that the tribulaciouns of this world but litel whyle endure and sone passed been and goon.  and the ioye that a man seketh to have by pacience in tribulaciouns is perdurable after that the apostle seith in his epistle:  the ioye of god he seith is perdurable that is to seyn everlastinge.  also troweth and bileveth stedefastly that he nis nat wel ynorissed ne wel ytaught that can nat have pacience or wol nat receyve pacience.  for salomon seith: that the doctrine and the wit of a man is knowen by pacience.  and in another place he seith: that he that is pacient governeth him by greet prudence.  and the same salomon seith: the angry and wrathful man maketh noyses and the pacient man atempreth hem and stilleth.  he seith also: it is more worth to be pacient than for to be right strong;  and he that may have the lordshipe of his owene herte is more to preyse than he that by his force or strengthe taketh grete citees.  and therfore seith seint iame in his epistle: that pacience is a greet vertu of perfeccioun.   . certes quod melibee i graunte yow dame prudence that pacience is a greet vertu of perfeccioun;  but every man may nat have the perfeccioun that ye seken;  ne i nam nat of the nombre of right parfite men  for myn herte may never been in pees unto the tyme it be venged.  and albeit so that it was greet peril to myne enemys to do me a vileinye in takinge vengeance upon me  yet token they noon hede of the peril but fulfilleden hir wikked wil and hir corage.  and therfore me thinketh men oghten nat repreve me though i putte me in a litel peril for to venge me  and though i do a greet excesse that is to seyn that i venge oon outrage by another.   . a! quod dame prudence ye seyn your wil and as yow lyketh;  but in no caas of the world a man sholde nat doon outrage ne excesse for to vengen him.  for cassidore seith: that as yvel doth he that vengeth him by outrage as he that doth the outrage.  and therfore ye shul venge yow after the ordre of right that is to seyn by the lawe and noght by excesse ne by outrage.  and also if ye wol venge yow of the outrage of your adversaries in other maner than right comandeth ye sinnen;  and therfore seith senek: that a man shal never vengen shrewednesse by shrewednesse.  and if ye seye that right axeth a man to defenden violence by violence and fighting by fighting  certes ye seye sooth whan the defense is doon anon withouten intervalle or withouten tarying or delay  for to defenden him and nat for to vengen him.  and it bihoveth that a man putte swich attemperance in his defence  that men have no cause ne matere to repreven him that defendeth him of excesse and outrage; for elles were it agayn resoun.  pardee ye knowen wel that ye maken no defence as now for to defende yow but for to venge yow;  and so seweth it that ye han no wil to do your dede attemprely.  and therfore me thinketh that pacience is good. for salomon seith: that he that is nat pacient shal have greet harm.   . certes quod melibee i graunte yow that whan a man is inpacient and wroth of that that toucheth him noght and that aperteneth nat unto him though it harme him it is no wonder.  for the lawe seith: that he is coupable that entremetteth or medleth with swich thyng as aperteneth nat unto him.  and salomon seith: that he that entremetteth him of the noyse or stryf of another man is lyk to him that taketh an hound by the eres.  for right as he that taketh a straunge hound by the eres is outherwhyle biten with the hound  right in the same wyse is it resoun that he have harm that by his inpacience medleth him of the noyse of another man wheras it aperteneth nat unto him.  but ye knowen wel that this dede that is to seyn my grief and my disese toucheth me right ny.  and therfore though i be wroth and inpacient it is no merveille.  and savinge your grace i can nat seen that it mighte greetly harme me though i toke vengeaunce;  for i am richer and more mighty than myne enemys been.  and wel knowen ye that by moneye and by havinge grete possessions been all the thinges of this world governed.  and salomon seith: that alle thinges obeyen to moneye.   . whan prudence hadde herd hir housbonde avanten him of his richesse and of his moneye dispreisinge the power of hise adversaries she spak and seyde in this wyse:  certes dere sir i graunte yow that ye been rich and mighty  and that the richesses been goode to hem that han wel ygeten hem and wel conne usen hem.  for right as the body of a man may nat liven withoute the soule namore may it live withouten temporel goodes.  and by richesses may a man gete him grete freendes.  and therfore seith pamphilles: if a netherdes doghter seith he be riche she may chesen of a thousand men which she wol take to hir housbonde;  for of a thousand men oon wol nat forsaken hir ne refusen hir.  and this pamphilles seith also: if thou be right happy that is to seyn if thou be right riche thou shalt find a greet nombre of felawes and freendes.  and if thy fortune change that thou wexe povre farewel freendshipe and felaweshipe;  for thou shalt be allone withouten any companye butif it be the companye of povre folk.  and yet seith this pamphilles moreover: that they that been thralle and bonde of linage shullen been maad worthy and noble by the richesses.  and right so as by richesses ther comen manye goodes right so by poverte come ther manye harmes and yveles.  for greet poverte constreyneth a man to do manye yveles.  and therfore clepeth cassidore poverte the moder of ruine  that is to seyn the moder of overthrowinge or fallinge doun.  and therfore seith piers alfonce: oon of the gretteste adversitees of this world is  whan a free man by kinde or by burthe is constreyned by poverte to eten the almesse of his enemy.  and the same seith innocent in oon of hise bokes; he seith: that sorweful and mishappy is the condicioun of a povre begger;  for if he axe nat his mete he dyeth for hunger;  and if he axe he dyeth for shame; and algates necessitee constreyneth him to axe.  and therfore seith salomon: that bet it is to dye than for to have swich poverte.  and as the same salomon seith: bettre it is to dye of bitter deeth than for to liven in swich wyse.  by thise resons that i have seid unto yow and by manye othere resons that i coude seye  i graunte yow that richesses been goode to hem that geten hem wel and to hem that wel usen tho richesses.  and therfore wol i shewe yow how ye shul have yow and how ye shul here yow in gaderinge of richesses and in what manere ye shul usen hem.   . first ye shul geten hem withouten greet desyr by good leyser sokingly and nat over hastily.  for a man that is to desyringe to gete richesses abaundoneth him first to thefte and to alle other yveles.  and therfore seith salomon: he that hasteth him to bisily to wexe riche shal be noon innocent.  he seith also: that the richesse that hastily cometh to a man sone and lightly gooth and passeth fro a man;  but that richesse that cometh litel and litel wexeth alwey and multiplyeth.  and sir ye shul geten richesses by your wit and by your travaille unto your profit;  and that withouten wrong or harmdoinge to any other persone.  for the lawe seith: that ther maketh no man himselven riche if he do harm to another wight;  this is to seyn that nature defendeth and forbedeth by right that no man make himself riche unto the harm of another persone.  and tullius seith: that no sorwe ne no drede of deeth ne nothing that may falle unto a man  is so muchel agayns nature as a man to encressen his owene profit to the harm of another man.  and though the grete men and the mighty men geten richesses more lightly than thou  yet shaltou nat been ydel ne slow to do thy profit; for thou shalt in alle wyse flee ydelnesse.  for salomon seith: that ydelnesse techeth a man to do manye yveles.  and the same salomon seith: that he that travailleth and bisieth him to tilien his land shal eten breed;  but he that is ydel and casteth him to no bisinesse ne occupacioun shal falle into poverte and dye for hunger.  and he that is ydel and slow can never finde covenable tyme for to doon his profit.  for ther is a versifiour seith: that the ydel man excuseth hym in winter by cause of the grete cold; and in somer by enchesoun of the hete.  for thise causes seith caton: waketh and enclyneth nat yow over muchel for to slepe; for over muchel reste norisseth and causeth manye vices.  and therfore seith seint ierome: doth somme gode dedes that the devel which is our enemy ne finde yow nat unoccupied.  for the devel ne taketh nat lightly unto his werkinge swiche as he findeth occupied in gode werkes.   . thanne thus in getinge richesses ye mosten flee ydelnesse.  and afterward ye shul use the richesses whiche ye have geten by your wit and by your travaille  in swich a manere that men holde nat yow to scars ne to sparinge ne to foollarge that is to seyn overlarge a spender.  for right as men blamen an avaricious man bycause of his scarsetee and chincherye  in the same wyse is he to blame that spendeth over largely.  and therfore seith caton: use he seith thy richesses that thou hast geten  in swich a manere that men have no matere ne cause to calle thee neither wrecche ne chinche;  for it is a greet shame to a man to have a povere herte and a riche purs.  he seith also: the goodes that thou hast ygeten use hem by mesure that is to seyn spende hem mesurably;  for they that folily wasten and despenden the goodes that they han  whan they han namore propre of hir owene they shapen hem to take the goodes of another man.  i seye thanne that ye shul fleen avarice;  usinge your richesses in swich manere that men seye nat that your richesses been yburied  but that ye have hem in your might and in your weeldinge.  for a wys man repreveth the avaricious man and seith thus in two vers:  wherto and why burieth a man hise goodes by his grete avarice and knoweth wel that nedes moste he dye;  for deeth is the ende of every man as in this present lyf.  and for what cause or enchesoun ioyneth he him or knitteth he him so faste unto hise goodes  that alle his wittes mowen nat disseveren him or departen him from hise goodes;  and knoweth wel or oghte knowe that whan he is deed he shal nothing bere with him out of this world.  and therfore seith seint augustin: that the avaricious man is likned unto helle;  that the more it swelweth the more desyr it hath to swelwe and devoure.  and as wel as ye wolde eschewe to be called an avaricious man or chinche  as wel sholde ye kepe yow and governe yow in swich a wyse that men calle yow nat foollarge.  therfore seith tullius: the goodes he seith of thyn hous ne sholde nat been hid ne kept so cloos but that they mighte been opened by pitee and debonairetee;  that is to seyn to yeven part to hem that han greet nede;  ne thy goodes shullen nat been so opene to been every mannes goodes.  afterward in getinge of your richesses and in usinge hem ye shul alwey have three thinges in your herte;  that is to seyn our lord god conscience and good name.  first ye shul have god in your herte;  and for no richesse ye shullen do nothing which may in any manere displese god that is your creatour and maker.  for after the word of salomon: it is bettre to have a litel good with the love of god  than to have muchel good and tresour and lese the love of his lord god.  and the prophete seith: that bettre it is to been a good man and have litel good and tresour  than to been holden a shrewe and have grete richesses.  and yet seye i ferthermore that ye sholde alwey doon your bisinesse to gete yow richesses  so that ye gete hem with good conscience.  and thapostle seith: that ther nis thing in this world of which we sholden have so greet ioye as whan our conscience bereth us good witnesse.  and the wyse man seith: the substance of a man is ful good whan sinne is nat in mannes conscience.  afterward in getinge of your richesses and in usinge of hem  yow moste have greet bisinesse and greet diligence that your goode name be alwey kept and conserved.  for salomon seith: that bettre it is and more it availleth a man to have a good name than for to have grete richesses.  and therfore he seith in another place: do greet diligence seith salomon in keping of thy freend and of thy gode name;  for it shal lenger abide with thee than any tresour be it never so precious.  and certes he sholde nat be called a gentil man that after god and good conscience alle thinges left ne dooth his diligence and bisinesse to kepen his good name.  and cassidore seith: that it is signe of a gentil herte whan a man loveth and desyreth to han a good name.  and therfore seith seint augustin: that ther been two thinges that arn necessarie and nedefulle  and that is good conscience and good loos;  that is to seyn good conscience to thyn owene persone inward and good loos for thy neighebore outward.  and he that trusteth him so muchel in his gode conscience  that he displeseth and setteth at noght his gode name or loos and rekketh noght though he kepe nat his gode name nis but a cruel cherl.   . sire now have i shewed yow how ye shul do in getinge richesses and how ye shullen usen hem;  and i se wel that for the trust that ye han in youre richesses ye wole moeve werre and bataille.  i conseille yow that ye biginne no werre in trust of your richesses; for they ne suffysen noght werres to mayntene.  and therfore seith a philosophre: that man that desyreth and wole algates han werre shal never have suffisaunce;  for the richer that he is the gretter despenses moste he make if he wole have worship and victorie.  and salomon seith: that the gretter richesses that a man hath the mo despendours he hath.  and dere sire albeit so that for your richesses ye mowe have muchel folk  yet bihoveth it nat ne it is nat good to biginne werre whereas ye mowe in other manere have pees unto your worship and profit.  for the victories of batailles that been in this world lyen nat in greet nombre or multitude of the peple ne in the vertu of man;  but it lyth in the wil and in the hand of our lord god almighty.  and therfore iudas machabeus which was goddes knight  whan he sholde fighte agayn his adversarie that hadde a greet nombre and a gretter multitude of folk and strenger than was this peple of machabee  yet he reconforted his litel companye and seyde right in this wyse:  als lightly quod he may our lord god almighty yeve victorie to a fewe folk as to many folk;  for the victorie of bataile cometh nat by the grete nombre of peple  but it cometh from our lord god of hevene.  and dere sir for as muchel as there is no man certein if he be worthy that god yeve him victorie namore than he is certein whether he be worthy of the love of god or naught after that salomon seith  therfore every man sholde greetly drede werres to biginne.  and bycause that in batailles fallen manye perils  and happeth outherwhile that as sone is the grete man sleyn as the litel man;  and as it is written in the seconde book of kinges the dedes of batailles been aventurouse and nothing certeyne;  for as lightly is oon hurt with a spere as another.  and for ther is gret peril in werre therfore sholde a man flee and eschewe werre in as muchel as a man may goodly.  for salomon seith: he that loveth peril shal falle in peril.   . after that dame prudence hadde spoken in this manere melibee answerde and seyde  i see wel dame prudence that by your faire wordes and by your resons that ye han shewed me that the werre lyketh yow nothing;  but i have nat yet herd your conseil how i shal do in this nede.   . certes quod she i conseille yow that ye accorde with youre adversaries and that ye haue pees with hem.  for seint iame seith in hise epistles: that by concord and pees the smale richesses wexen grete  and by debaat and discord the grete richesses fallen doun.  and ye knowen wel that oon of the gretteste and most sovereyn thing that is in this world is unitee and pees.  and therfore seyde oure lord iesu crist to hise apostles in this wyse:  wel happy and blessed been they that loven and purchacen pees; for they been called children of god.  a! quod melibee now se i wel that ye loven nat myn honour ne my worshipe.  ye knowen wel that myne adversaries han bigonnen this debaat and brige by hir outrage;  and ye see wel that they ne requeren ne preyen me nat of pees ne they asken nat to be reconsiled.  wol ye thanne that i go and meke me and obeye me to hem and crye hem mercy?  for sothe that were nat my worship.  for right as men seyn that overgreet homlinesse engendreth dispreysinge so fareth it by to greet humylitee or mekenesse.   . thanne bigan dame prudence to maken semblant of wratthe and seyde  certes sir sauf your grace i love your honour and your profit as i do myn owene and ever have doon;  ne ye ne noon other syen never the contrarie.  and yit if i hadde seyd that ye sholde han purchaced the pees and the reconsiliacioun i ne hadde nat muchel mistaken me ne seyd amis.  for the wyse man seith: the dissensioun biginneth by another man and the reconsiling biginneth by thyself.  and the prophete seith: flee shrewednesse and do goodnesse;  seke pees and folwe it as muchel as in thee is.  yet seye i nat that ye shul rather pursue to your adversaries for pees than they shuln to yow;  for i knowe wel that ye been so hardherted that ye wol do nothing for me.  and salomon seith: he that hath overhard an herte atte laste he shal mishappe and mistyde.   . whanne melibee hadde herd dame prudence maken semblant of wratthe he seyde in this wyse  dame i prey yow that ye be nat displesed of thinges that i seye;  for ye knowe wel that i am angry and wrooth and that is no wonder;  and they that been wrothe witen nat wel what they doon ne what they seyn.  therfore the prophete seith: that troubled eyen han no cleer sighte.  but seyeth and conseileth me as yow lyketh; for i am redy to do right as ye wol desyre;  and if ye repreve me of my folye i am the more holden to love yow and to preyse yow.  for salomon seith: that he that repreveth him that doth folye  he shal finde gretter grace than he that deceyveth him by swete wordes.   . thanne seide dame prudence i make no semblant of wratthe ne anger but for your grete profit.  for salomon seith: he is more worth that repreveth or chydeth a fool for his folye shewinge him semblant of wratthe  than he that supporteth him and preyseth him in his misdoinge and laugheth at his folye.  and this same salomon seith afterward: that by the sorweful visage of a man that is to seyn by the sory and hevy countenaunce of a man  the fool correcteth and amendeth himself.   . thanne seyde melibee i shal nat conne answere to so manye faire resouns as ye putten to me and shewen.  seyeth shortly your wil and your conseil and i am al ready to fulfille and parfourne it.   . thanne dame prudence discovered al hir wil to him and seyde  i conseille yow quod she aboven alle thinges that ye make pees bitwene god and yow;  and beth reconsiled unto him and to his grace.  for as i have seyd yow heerbiforn god hath suffred yow to have this tribulacioun and disese for your sinnes.  and if ye do as i sey yow god wol sende your adversaries unto yow  and maken hem fallen at your feet redy to do your wil and your comandements.  for salomon seith: whan the condicioun of man is plesaunt and likinge to god  he chaungeth the hertes of the mannes adversaries and constreyneth hem to biseken him of pees and of grace.  and i prey yow lat me speke with your adversaries in privee place;  for they shul nat knowe that it be of your wil or your assent.  and thanne whan i knowe hir wil and hir entente i may conseille yow the more seurly.   . dame quod melibee dooth your wil and your lykinge  for i putte me hoolly in your disposicioun and ordinaunce.   . thanne dame prudence whan she saugh the gode wil of her housbonde delibered and took avys in hirself  thinkinge how she mighte bringe this nede unto a good conclusioun and to a good ende.  and whan she saugh hir tyme she sente for thise adversaries to come unto hir into a privee place  and shewed wysly unto hem the grete goodes that comen of pees  and the grete harmes and perils that been in werre;  and seyde to hem in a goodly manere how that hem oughte have greet repentaunce  of the iniurie and wrong that they hadden doon to melibee hir lord and to hir and to hir doghter.   . and whan they herden the goodliche wordes of dame prudence  they weren so surprised and ravisshed and hadden so greet ioye of hir that wonder was to telle.  a! lady! quod they ye han shewed unto us the blessinge of swetnesse after the sawe of david the prophete;  for the reconsilinge which we been nat worthy to have in no manere  but we oghte requeren it with greet contricioun and humilitee  ye of your grete goodnesse have presented unto us.  now see we wel that the science and the conninge of salomon is ful trewe;  for he seith: that swete wordes multiplyen and encresen freendes and maken shrewes to be debonaire and meke.   . certes quod they we putten our dede and al our matere and cause al hoolly in your goode wil;  and been redy to obeye to the speche and comandement of my lord melibee.  and therfore dere and benigne lady we preyen yow and biseke yow as mekely as we conne and mowen  that it lyke unto your grete goodnesse to fulfillen in dede your goodliche wordes;  for we consideren and knowlichen that we han offended and greved my lord melibee out of mesure;  so ferforth that we be nat of power to maken hise amendes.  and therfore we oblige and binden us and our freendes to doon al his wil and hise comandements.  but peraventure he hath swich hevinesse and swich wratthe to usward bycause of our offence  that he wole enioyne us swich a peyne as we mowe nat here ne sustene.  and therfore noble lady we biseke to your wommanly pitee  to taken swich avysement in this nede that we ne our freendes be nat desherited ne destroyed thurgh our folye.   . certes quod prudence it is an hard thing and right perilous  that a man putte him al outrely in the arbitracioun and iuggement and in the might and power of hise enemys.  for salomon seith: leveth me and yeveth credence to that i shal seyn; i seye quod he ye peple folk and governours of holy chirche  to thy sone to thy wyf to thy freend ne to thy brother  ne yeve thou never might ne maistrie of thy body whyl thou livest.  now sithen he defendeth that man shal nat yeven to his brother ne to his freend the might of his body  by a strenger resoun he defendeth and forbedeth a man to yeven himself to his enemy.  and nathelees i conseille you that ye mistruste nat my lord.  for i wool wel and knowe verraily that he is debonaire and meke large curteys  and nothing desyrous ne coveitous of good ne richesse.  for ther nis nothing in this world that he desyreth save only worship and honour.  forthermore i knowe wel and am right seur that he shal nothing doon in this nede withouten my conseil.  and i shal so werken in this cause that by grace of our lord god ye shul been reconsiled unto us.   . thanne seyden they with o vois worshipful lady we putten us and our goodes al fully in your wil and disposicioun;  and been redy to comen what day that it lyke unto your noblesse to limite us or assigne us  for to maken our obligacioun and bond as strong as it lyketh unto your goodnesse;  that we mowe fulfille the wille of yow and of my lord melibee.   . whan dame prudence hadde herd the answeres of thise men she bad hem goon agayn prively;  and she retourned to hir lord melibee and tolde him how she fond hise adversaries ful repentant  knowlechinge ful lowely hir sinnes and trespas and how they were redy to suffren al peyne  requiringe and preyinge him of mercy and pitee.   . thanne seyde melibee he is wel worthy to have pardoun and foryifnesse of his sinne that excuseth nat his sinne  but knowlecheth it and repenteth him axinge indulgence.  for senek seith: ther is the remissioun and foryifnesse whereas confessioun is;  for confession is neighebore to innocence.  and he seith in another place: he that hath shame for his sinne and knowlecheth it is worthy remissioun. and therfore i assente and conferme me to have pees;  but it is good that we do it nat withouten the assent and wil of our freendes.   . thanne was prudence right glad and loyeful and seyde  certes sir quod she ye han wel and goodly answered.  for right as by the conseil assent and help of your freendes ye han been stired to venge yow and maken werre  right so withouten hir conseil shul ye nat accorden yow ne have pees with your adversaries.  for the lawe seith: ther nis nothing so good by wey of kinde as a thing to been unbounde by him that it was ybounde.   . and thanne dame prudence withouten delay or taryinge sente anon hir messages for hir kin and for hir olde freendes whiche that were trewe and wyse  and tolde hem by ordre in the presence of melibee al this matere as it is aboven expressed and declared;  and preyden hem that they wolde yeven hir avys and conseil what best were to doon in this nede.  and whan melibees freendes hadde taken hir avys and deliberacioun of the forseide matere  and hadden examined it by greet bisinesse and greet diligence  they yave ful conseil for to have pees and reste;  and that melibee sholde receyve with good herte hise adversaries to foryifnesse and mercy.   . and whan dame prudence hadde herd the assent of hir lord melibee and the conseil of hise freendes  accorde with hir wille and hir entencioun  she was wonderly glad in hir herte and seyde:  ther is an old proverbe quod she seith: that the goodnesse that thou mayst do this day do it;  and abyde nat ne delaye it nat til tomorwe.  and therfore i conseille that ye sende your messages swiche as been discrete and wyse  unto your adversaries; tellinge hem on your bihalve  that if they wole trete of pees and of accord  that they shape hem withouten delay or tarying to comen unto us.  which thing parfourned was in dede.  and whanne thise trespassours and repentinge folk of hir folies that is to seyn the adversaries of melibee  hadden herd what thise messagers seyden unto hem  they weren right glad and ioyeful and answereden ful mekely and benignely  yeldinge graces and thankinges to hir lord melibee and to al his companye;  and shopen hem withouten delay to go with the messagers and obeye to the comandement of hir lord melibee.   . and right anon they token hir wey to the court of melibee  and token with hem somme of hir trewe freendes to maken feith for hem and for to been hir borwes.  and whan they were comen to the presence of melibee he seyde hem thise wordes:  it standeth thus quod melibee and sooth it is that ye  causeless and withouten skile and resoun  han doon grete iniuries and wronges to me and to my wyf prudence and to my doghter also.  for ye han entred into myn hous by violence  and have doon swich outrage that alle men knowen wel that ye have deserved the deeth;  and therfore wol i knowe and wite of yow  whether ye wol putte the punissement and the chastysinge and the vengeance of this outrage in the wil of me and of my wyf prudence; or ye wol nat?   . thanne the wyseste of hem three answerde for hem alle and seyde:  sire quod he we knowen wel that we been unworthy to comen unto the court of so greet a lord and so worthy as ye been.  for we han so greetly mistaken us and han offended and agilt in swich a wyse agayn your heigh lordshipe  that trewely we han deserved the deeth.  but yet for the grete goodnesse and debonairetee that all the world witnesseth of your persone  we submitten us to the excellence and benignitee of your gracious lordshipe  and been redy to obeie to alle your comandements;  bisekinge yow that of your merciable pitee ye wol considere our grete repentaunce and lowe submissioun  and graunten us foryevenesse of our outrageous trespas and offence.  for wel we knowe that your liberal grace and mercy strecchen hem ferther into goodnesse than doon our outrageouse giltes and trespas into wikkednesse;  albeit that cursedly and dampnably we han agilt agayn your heigh lordshipe.   . thanne melibee took hem up fro the ground ful benignely  and receyved hir obligaciouns and hir bondes by hir othes upon hir plegges and borwes  and assigned hem a certeyn day to retourne unto his court  for to accepte and receyve the sentence and iugement that melibee wolde comande to be doon on hem by the causes aforeseyd;  whiche thinges ordeyned every man retourned to his hous.   . and whan that dame prudence saugh hir tyme she freyned and axed hir lord melibee  what vengeance he thoughte to taken of hise adversaries?   . to which melibee answerde and seyde certes quod he i thinke and purpose me fully  to desherite hem of al that ever they han and for to putte hem in exil for ever.   . certes quod dame prudence this were a cruel sentence and muchel agayn resoun.  for ye been riche ynough and han no nede of other mennes good;  and ye mighte lightly in this wyse gete yow a coveitous name  which is a vicious thing and oghte been eschewed of every good man.  for after the sawe of the word of the apostle: coveitise is rote of alle harmes.  and therfore it were bettre for yow to lese so muchel good of your owene than for to taken of hir good in this manere.  for bettre it is to lesen good with worshipe than it is to winne good with vileinye and shame.  and every man oghte to doon his diligence and his bisinesse to geten him a good name.  and yet shal he nat only bisie him in kepinge of his good name  but he shal also enforcen him alwey to do somthing by which he may renovelle his good name;  for it is writen that the olde good loos or good name of a man is sone goon and passed whan it is nat newed ne renovelled.  and as touchinge that ye seyn ye wole exile your adversaries  that thinketh me muchel agayn resoun and out of mesure  considered the power that they han yeve yow upon hemself.  and it is writen that he is worthy to lesen his privilege that misuseth the might and the power that is yeven him.  and i sette cas ye mighte enioyne hem that peyne by right and by lawe  which i trowe ye mowe nat do  i seye ye mighte nat putten it to execucioun peraventure  and thanne were it lykly to retourne to the werre as it was biforn.  and therfore if ye wole that men do yow obeisance ye moste demen more curteisly;  this is to seyn ye moste yeven more esy sentences and iugements.  for it is writen that he that most curteisly comandeth to him men most obeyen.  and therfore i prey yow that in this necessitee and in this nede ye caste yow to overcome your herte.  for senek seith: that he that overcometh his herte overcometh twyes.  and tullius seith: ther is nothing so comendable in a greet lord  as whan he is debonaire and meke and appeseth him lightly.  and i prey yow that ye wole forbere now to do vengeance  in swich a manere that your goode name may be kept and conserved;  and that men mowe have cause and matere to preyse yow of pitee and of mercy;  and that ye have no cause to repente yow of thing that ye doon.  for senek seith: he overcometh in an yvel manere that repenteth him of his victorie.  wherfore i pray yow lat mercy been in your minde and in your herte  to theffect and entente that god almighty have mercy on yow in his laste iugement.  for seint iame seith in his epistle: iugement withouten mercy shal be doon to him that hath no mercy of another wight.   . whanne melibee hadde herd the grete skiles and resouns of dame prudence and hir wise informaciouns and techinges  his herte gan enclyne to the wil of his wyf consideringe hir trewe entente;  and conformed him anon and assented fully to werken after hir conseil;  and thonked god of whom procedeth al vertu and alle goodnesse that him sente a wyf of so greet discrecioun.  and whan the day cam that hise adversaries sholde apperen in his presence  he spak unto hem ful goodly and seyde in this wyse:  albeit so that of your pryde and presumpcioun and folie and of your necligence and unconninge  ye have misborn yow and trespassed unto me;  yet for as much as i see and biholde your grete humilitee  and that ye been sory and repentant of your giltes  it constreyneth me to doon yow grace and mercy.  therfore i receyve yow to my grace  and foryeve yow outrely alle the offences iniuries and wronges that ye have doon agayn me and myne;  to this effect and to this ende that god of his endelees mercy  wole at the tyme of our dyinge foryeven us our giltes that we han trespassed to him in this wrecched world.  for doutelees if we be sory and repentant of the sinnes and giltes whiche we han trespassed in the sighte of our lord god  he is so free and so merciable  that he wole foryeven us our giltes  and bringen us to his blisse that never hath ende. amen.  here is ended chaucers tale of melibee and of dame prudence. the mery wordes of the host to the monk. whan ended was my tale of melibee and of prudence and hir benignitee  our hoste seyde as i am faithful man and by the precious corpus madrian i hadde lever than a barel ale that goode lief my wyf hadde herd this tale! for she nis nothing of swich pacience  as was this melibeus wyf prudence. by goddes bones! whan i bete my knaves she bringth me forth the grete clobbed staves  and cryeth slee the dogges everichoon and brek hem bothe bak and every boon.  and if that any neighebor of myne wol nat in chirche to my wyf enclyne or be so hardy to hir to trespace whan she comth hoom she rampeth in my face and cryeth false coward wreek thy wyf  by corpus bones! i wol have thy knyf and thou shalt have my distaf and go spinne! fro day to night right thus she wol biginne;

thou woldest han been a tredefoul aright.  haddestow as greet a leve as thou hast might to parfourne al thy lust in engendrure thou haddest bigeten many a creature.  alas! why werestow so wyd a cope? god yeve me sorwe! but and i were a pope  not only thou but every mighty man thogh he were shorn ful hye upon his pan sholde have a wyf;

god woot no lussheburghes payen ye! but be nat wrooth my lord for that i pleye; ful ofte in game a sooth i have herd seye. this worthy monk took al in pacience  and seyde i wol doon al my diligence as fer as souneth into honestee to telle yow a tale or two or three.  and if yow list to herkne hiderward i wol yow seyn the lyf of seint edward;  or elles first tragedies wol i telle of whiche i have an hundred in my celle. tragedie is to seyn a certeyn storie as olde bokes maken us memorie of him that stood in greet prosperitee  and is yfallen out of heigh degree into miserie and endeth wrecchedly. and they ben versifyed comunly  of six feet which men clepe exametron. in prose eek been endyted many oon  and eek in metre in many a sondry wyse. lo! this declaring oughte ynough suffise. now herkneth if yow lyketh for to here; but first i yow biseke in this matere though i by ordre telle nat thise thinges  be it of popes emperours or kinges after hir ages as men writen finde but telle hem som bifore and som bihinde  as it now comth unto my remembraunce; have me excused of myn ignoraunce.  explicit. here biginneth the monkes tale de casibus virorum illustrium. i wol biwayle in maner of tragedie the harm of hem that stode in heigh degree and fillen so that ther nas no remedie to bringe hem out of hir adversitee; for certein whan that fortune list to flee  ther may no man the cours of hir withholde; lat no man truste on blind prosperitee; be war by thise ensamples trewe and olde. lucifer. at lucifer though he an angel were and nat a man at him i wol biginne;  for thogh fortune may non angel dere  from heigh degree yet fel he for his sinne doun into helle wher he yet is inne. o lucifer! brightest of angels alle now artow sathanas that maist nat twinne  out of miserie in which that thou art falle. adam. lo adam in the feld of damassene with goddes owene finger wroght was he and nat bigeten of mannes sperme unclene and welte al paradys saving o tree.  had never worldly man so heigh degree  as adam til he for misgovernaunce was drive out of his hye prosperitee to labour and to helle and to meschaunce. sampson. lo sampson which that was annunciat  by thangel longe er his nativitee and was to god almighty consecrat and stood in noblesse whyl he mighte see. was never swich another as was he to speke of strengthe and therwith hardinesse;  but to his wyves tolde he his secree  through which he slow himself for wrecchednesse. sampson this noble almighty champioun withouten wepen save his hondes tweye he slow and al torente the leoun  toward his wedding walking by the weye. his false wyf coude him so plese and preye til she his conseil knew and she untrewe unto his foos his conseil gan biwreye and him forsook and took another newe.  three hundred foxes took sampson for ire  and alle hir tayles he togider bond and sette the foxes tayles alle on fire for he on every tayl had knit a brond; and they brende alle the cornes in that lond  and alle hir oliveres and vynes eek. a thousand men he slow eek with his hond and had no wepen but an asses cheek. whan they were slayn so thursted him that he was wel ny lorn for which he gan to preye  that god wolde on his peyne han som pitee  and sende him drinke or elles moste he deye; and of this asses cheke that was dreye out of a wangtooth sprang anon a welle of which he drank ynogh shortly to seye  thus heelp him god as iudicum can telle. by verray force at gazan on a night maugree philistiens of that citee the gates of the toun he hath upplight and on his bak ycaried hem hath he  hye on an hille that men mighte hem see.  o noble almighty sampson leef and dere had thou nat told to wommen thy secree in al this worlde ne hadde been thy pere! this sampson never sicer drank ne wyn  ne on his heed cam rasour noon ne shere by precept of the messager divyn for alle his strengthes in his heres were; and fully twenty winter yeer by yere he hadde of israel the governaunce.  but sone shal he wepen many a tere  for wommen shal him bringen to meschaunce! unto his lemman dalida he tolde that in his heres al his strengthe lay and falsly to his fomen she him solde.  and sleping in hir barme upon a day she made to clippe or shere his heer awey and made his fomen al his craft espyen; and whan that they him fonde in this array they bounde him faste and putten out his yen.  but er his heer were clipped or yshave  ther was no bond with which men might him binde; but now is he in prisoun in a cave wheras they made him at the querne grinde. o noble sampson strongest of mankinde  o whylom iuge in glorie and in richesse now maystow wepen with thyn yen blinde sith thou fro wele art falle in wrecchednesse. thende of this caytif was as i shal seye; his fomen made a feste upon a day  and made him as hir fool bifore hem pleye  and this was in a temple of greet array. but atte laste he made a foul affray; for he two pilers shook and made hem falle and doun fil temple and al and ther it lay  and slow himself and eek his fomen alle. this is to seyn the princes everichoon and eek three thousand bodies wer ther slayn with falling of the grete temple of stoon. of sampson now wol i namore seyn.  beth war by this ensample old and playn  that no men telle hir conseil til hir wyves of swich thing as they wolde han secree fayn if that it touche hir limmes or hir lyves. hercules. of hercules the sovereyn conquerour  singen his workes laude and heigh renoun; for in his tyme of strengthe he was the flour. he slow and rafte the skin of the leoun; he of centauros leyde the boost adoun; he arpies slow the cruel briddes felle;  he golden apples rafte of the dragoun;  he drow out cerberus the hound of helle: he slow the cruel tyrant busirus and made his hors to frete him flesh and boon; he slow the firy serpent venimous;  of achelois two hornes he brak oon; and he slow cacus in a cave of stoon; he slow the geaunt antheus the stronge; he slow the grisly boor and that anoon and bar the heven on his nekke longe.  was never wight sith that the world bigan  that slow so many monstres as dide he. thurghout this wyde world his name ran what for his strengthe and for his heigh bountee and every reaume wente he for to see.  he was so strong that no man mighte him lette; at bothe the worldes endes seith trophee in stede of boundes he a piler sette. a lemman hadde this noble champioun that highte dianira fresh as may;  and as thise clerkes maken mencioun  she hath him sent a sherte fresh and gay. allas! this sherte allas and weylaway! envenimed was so subtilly withalle that er that he had wered it half a day  it made his flesh al from his bones falle. but nathelees somme clerkes hir excusen by oon that highte nessus that it maked; be as be may i wol hir noght accusen; but on his bak this sherte he wered al naked  til that his flesh was for the venim blaked.  and whan he sey noon other remedye in hote coles he hath himselven raked for with no venim deyned him to dye. thus starf this worthy mighty hercules;  lo who may truste on fortune any throwe? for him that folweth al this world of prees er he be war is ofte yleyd ful lowe. ful wys is he that can himselven knowe. beth war for whan that fortune list to glose  than wayteth she hir man to overthrowe  by swich a wey as he wolde leest suppose. nabugodonosor nebuchadnezzar. the mighty trone the precious tresor the glorious ceptre and royal magestee that hadde the king nabugodonosor  with tonge unnethe may discryved be. he twyes wan ierusalem the citee; the vessel of the temple he with him ladde. at babiloyne was his sovereyn see in which his glorie and his delyt he hadde.  the fairest children of the blood royal  of israel he leet do gelde anoon and maked ech of hem to been his thral. amonges othere daniel was oon that was the wysest child of everichoon;  for he the dremes of the king expouned wheras in chaldey clerk ne was ther noon that wiste to what fyn his dremes souned. this proude king leet make a statue of golde sixty cubytes long and seven in brede  to which image bothe yonge and olde  comaunded he to loute and have in drede; or in a fourneys ful of flambes rede he shal be brent that wolde noght obeye. but never wolde assente to that dede  daniel ne his yonge felawes tweye. this king of kinges proud was and elaat he wende that god that sit in magestee ne mighte him nat bireve of his estaat: but sodeynly he loste his dignitee  and lyk a beste him semed for to be  and eet hay as an oxe and lay theroute; in reyn with wilde bestes walked he til certein tyme was ycome aboute. and lyk an egles fetheres wexe his heres  his nayles lyk a briddes clawes were; til god relessed him a certein yeres and yaf him wit; and than with many a tere he thanked god and ever his lyf in fere was he to doon amis or more trespace;  and til that tyme he leyd was on his bere  he knew that god was ful of might and grace. balthasar belshazzar. his sone which that highte balthasar that heeld the regne after his fader day he by his fader coude nought be war  for proud he was of herte and of array; and eek an ydolastre was he ay. his hye estaat assured him in pryde. but fortune caste him doun and ther he lay and sodeynly his regne gan divyde.  a feste he made unto his lordes alle  upon a tyme and bad hem blythe be and than his officeres gan he calle goth bringeth forth the vessels tho quod he which that my fader in his prosperitee  out of the temple of ierusalem birafte and to our hye goddes thanke we of honour that our eldres with us lafte. his wyf his lordes and his concubynes ay dronken whyl hir appetytes laste  out of thise noble vessels sundry wynes;  and on a wal this king his yen caste and sey an hond armlees that wroot ful faste for fere of which he quook and syked sore. this hond that balthasar so sore agaste  wroot mane techel phares and namore. in al that lond magicien was noon that coude expoune what this lettre mente; but daniel expouned it anoon and seyde king god to thy fader lente  glorie and honour regne tresour rente:  and he was proud and nothing god ne dradde and therfor god gret wreche upon him sente and him birafte the regne that he hadde. he was out cast of mannes companye  with asses was his habitacioun and eet hey as a beste in weet and drye til that he knew by grace and by resoun that god of heven hath dominacioun over every regne and every creature;  and thanne had god of him compassioun  and him restored his regne and his figure. eek thou that art his sone art proud also and knowest alle thise thinges verraily and art rebel to god and art his fo.  thou drank eek of his vessels boldely; thy wyf eek and thy wenches sinfully dronke of the same vessels sondry wynes and heriest false goddes cursedly; therfor to thee yshapen ful gret pyne is.  this hand was sent from god that on the walle  wroot mane techel phares truste me; thy regne is doon thou weyest noght at alle; divyded is thy regne and it shal be to medes and to perses yeven quod he.  and thilke same night this king was slawe and darius occupyeth his degree thogh he therto had neither right ne lawe. lordinges ensample heerby may ye take how that in lordshipe is no sikernesse;  for whan fortune wol a man forsake  she bereth awey his regne and his richesse and eek his freendes bothe more and lesse; for what man that hath freendes thurgh fortune mishap wol make hem enemys i gesse:  this proverbe is ful sooth and ful commune. cenobia zenobia. cenobia of palimerie quene as writen persiens of hir noblesse so worthy was in armes and so kene that no wight passed hir in hardinesse  ne in linage ne in other gentillesse.  of kinges blode of perse is she descended; i seye nat that she hadde most fairnesse but of hir shape she mighte nat been amended. from hir childhede i finde that she fledde  office of wommen and to wode she wente; and many a wilde hertes blood she shedde with arwes brode that she to hem sente. she was so swift that she anon hem hente and whan that she was elder she wolde kille  leouns lepardes and beres al torente  and in hir armes welde hem at hir wille. she dorste wilde beestes dennes seke and rennen in the montaignes al the night and slepen under a bush and she coude eke  wrastlen by verray force and verray might with any yong man were he never so wight; ther mighte nothing in hir armes stonde. she kepte hir maydenhod from every wight to no man deigned hir for to be bonde.  but atte laste hir frendes han hir maried  to odenake a prince of that contree al were it so that she hem longe taried; and ye shul understonde how that he hadde swiche fantasyes as hadde she.  but nathelees whan they were knit infere they lived in ioye and in felicitee; for ech of hem hadde other leef and dere. save o thing that she never wolde assente by no wey that he sholde by hir lye  but ones for it was hir pleyn entente  to have a child the world to multiplye; and also sone as that she mighte espye that she was nat with childe with that dede than wolde she suffre him doon his fantasye  eftsone and nat but ones out of drede. and if she were with childe at thilke cast namore sholde he pleyen thilke game til fully fourty dayes weren past; than wolde she ones suffre him do the same.  al were this odenake wilde or tame  he gat namore of hir for thus she seyde it was to wyves lecherye and shame in other cas if that men with hem pleyde. two sones by this odenake hadde she  the whiche she kepte in vertu and lettrure; but now unto our tale turne we. i seye so worshipful a creature and wys therwith and large with mesure so penible in the werre and curteis eke  ne more labour mighte in werre endure  was noon thogh al this world men sholde seke. hir riche array ne mighte nat be told as wel in vessel as in hir clothing; she was al clad in perree and in gold  and eek she lafte noght for noon hunting to have of sondry tonges ful knowing whan that she leyser hadde and for to entende to lernen bokes was al hir lyking how she in vertu mighte hir lyf dispende.  and shortly of this storie for to trete  so doughty was hir housbonde and eek she that they conquered many regnes grete in the orient with many a fair citee apertenaunt unto the magestee  of rome and with strong hond helde hem ful faste;

with hir they made alliaunce by bonde to been in pees and lete hir ryde and pleye. the emperour of rome claudius  ne him bifore the romayn galien ne dorste never been so corageous ne noon ermyn ne noon egipcien ne surrien ne noon arabien within the feld that dorste with hir fighte  lest that she wolde hem with hir hondes slen  or with hir meynee putten hem to flighte. in kinges habit wente hir sones two as heires of hir fadres regnes alle and hermanno and thymalao  her names were as persiens hem calle. but ay fortune hath in hir hony galle; this mighty quene may no whyl endure. fortune out of hir regne made hir falle to wrecchednesse and to misaventure.  aurelian whan that the governaunce  of rome cam into his hondes tweye he shoop upon this queen to do vengeaunce and with his legiouns he took his weye toward cenobie and shortly for to seye  he made hir flee and atte laste hir hente and fettred hir and eek hir children tweye and wan the lond and hoom to rome he wente. amonges othere thinges that he wan hir char that was with gold wrought and perree  this grete romayn this aurelian  hath with him lad for that men sholde it see. biforen his triumphe walketh she with gilte cheynes on hir nekke hanging;

 thus ended is this mighty erl of pyse; from heigh estaat fortune awey him carf. of this tragedie it oghte ynough suffyse. whoso wol here it in a lenger wyse redeth the grete poete of itaille  that highte dant for he can al devyse  fro point to point nat o word wol he faille. t. . nero. although that nero were as vicious t. . as any feend that lyth ful lowe adoun yet he as telleth us swetonius  this wyde world hadde in subieccioun both est and west south and septemtrioun; of rubies saphires and of perles whyte were alle his clothes brouded up and doun; for he in gemmes greetly gan delyte.  more delicat more pompous of array  more proud was never emperour than he; that ilke cloth that he had wered o day after that tyme he nolde it never see. nettes of goldthred hadde he gret plentee  to fisshe in tybre whan him liste pleye. his lustes were al lawe in his decree for fortune as his freend him wolde obeye. he rome brende for his delicacye; the senatours he slow upon a day.  to here how men wolde wepe and crye;  and slow his brother and by his sister lay. his moder made he in pitous array; for he hir wombe slitte to biholde wher he conceyved was; so weilawey!  that he so litel of his moder tolde! no tere out of his yen for that sighte ne cam but seyde a fair womman was she. gret wonder is how that he coude or mighte be domesman of hir dede beautee.  the wyn to bringen him comaunded he  and drank anon; non other wo he made. whan might is ioyned unto crueltee allas! to depe wol the venim wade! in youthe a maister hadde this emperour  to teche him letterure and curteisye for of moralitee he was the flour as in his tyme butif bokes lye; and whyl this maister hadde of him maistrye he maked him so conning and so souple  that longe tyme it was er tirannye  or any vyce dorste on him uncouple. this seneca of which that i devyse bycause nero hadde of him swich drede for he fro vyces wolde him ay chastyse  discreetly as by worde and nat by dede; sir wolde he seyn an emperour moot nede be vertuous and hate tirannye for which he in a bath made him to blede on bothe his armes til he moste dye.  this nero hadde eek of acustumaunce  in youthe ageyn his maister for to ryse which afterward him thoughte a greet grevaunce; therfor he made him deyen in this wyse. but natheles this seneca the wyse  chees in a bath to deye in this manere rather than han another tormentyse; and thus hath nero slayn his maister dere. now fil it so that fortune list no lenger the hye pryde of nero to cheryce;  for though that he were strong yet was she strenger;  she thoughte thus by god i am to nyce to sette a man that is fulfild of vyce in heigh degree and emperour him calle. by god out of his sete i wol him tryce;  when he leest weneth sonest shal he falle. the peple roos upon him on a night for his defaute and whan he it espyed out of his dores anon he hath him dight alone and ther he wende han ben allyed  he knokked faste and ay the more he cryed  the faster shette they the dores alle; tho wiste he wel he hadde himself misgyed and wente his wey no lenger dorste he calle. the peple cryde and rombled up and doun  that with his eres herde he how they seyde wher is this false tyraunt this neroun? for fere almost out of his wit he breyde and to his goddes pitously he preyde for socour but it mighte nat bityde.  for drede of this him thoughte that he deyde  and ran into a gardin him to hyde. and in this gardin fond he cherles tweye that seten by a fyr ful greet and reed and to thise cherles two he gan to preye  to sleen him and to girden of his heed that to his body whan that he were deed were no despyt ydoon for his defame. himself he slow he coude no better reed of which fortune lough and hadde a game.  de oloferno holofernes. was never capitayn under a king  that regnes mo putte in subieccioun ne strenger was in feeld of alle thing as in his tyme ne gretter of renoun ne more pompous in heigh presumpcioun  than oloferne which fortune ay kiste so likerously and ladde him up and doun til that his heed was of er that he wiste. nat only that this world hadde him in awe for lesinge of richesse or libertee  but he made every man reneye his lawe.  nabugodonosor was god seyde he noon other god sholde adoured be. ageyns his heste no wight dar trespace save in bethulia a strong citee  wher eliachim a prest was of that place. but tak kepe of the deeth of olofern; amidde his host he dronke lay a night withinne his tente large as is a bern and yit for al his pompe and al his might  iudith a womman as he lay upright  sleping his heed of smoot and from his tente ful prively she stal from every wight and with his heed unto hir toun she wente. de rege anthiocho illustri. what nedeth it of king anthiochus  to telle his hye royal magestee his hye pryde his werkes venimous? for swich another was ther noon as he. rede which that he was in machabee and rede the proude wordes that he seyde  and why he fil fro heigh prosperitee  and in an hil how wrechedly he deyde. fortune him hadde enhaunced so in pryde that verraily he wende he mighte attayne unto the sterres upon every syde  and in balance weyen ech montayne and alle the flodes of the see restrayne. and goddes peple hadde he most in hate hem wolde he sleen in torment and in payne wening that god ne mighte his pryde abate.  and for that nichanor and thimothee  of iewes weren venquisshed mightily unto the iewes swich an hate hadde he that he bad greithe his char ful hastily and swoor and seyde ful despitously  unto ierusalem he wolde eftsone to wreken his ire on it ful cruelly; but of his purpos he was let ful sone. god for his manace him so sore smoot with invisible wounde ay incurable  that in his guttes carf it so and boot  that his peynes weren importable. and certeinly the wreche was resonable for many a mannes guttes dide he peyne; but from his purpos cursed and dampnable  for al his smert he wolde him nat restreyne; but bad anon apparaillen his host and sodeynly er he of it was war god daunted al his pryde and al his bost. for he so sore fil out of his char  that it his limes and his skin totar  so that he neither mighte go ne ryde but in a chayer men aboute him bar al forbrused bothe bak and syde. the wreche of god him smoot so cruelly  that thurgh his body wikked wormes crepte; and therwithal he stank so horribly that noon of al his meynee that him kepte whether so he wook or elles slepte ne mighte noght for stink of him endure.  in this meschief he wayled and eek wepte  and knew god lord of every creature. to al his host and to himself also ful wlatsom was the stink of his careyne; no man ne mighte him bere to ne fro.  and in this stink and this horrible peyne he starf ful wrecchedly in a monteyne. thus hath this robbour and this homicyde that many a man made to wepe and pleyne swich guerdon as bilongeth unto pryde.  de alexandro. the storie of alisaundre is so comune  that every wight that hath discrecioun hath herd somwhat or al of his fortune. this wyde world as in conclusioun he wan by strengthe or for his hye renoun  they weren glad for pees unto him sende. the pryde of man and beste he leyde adoun wherso he cam unto the worldes ende. comparisoun might never yit be maked bitwixe him and another conquerour;  for al this world for drede of him hath quaked  he was of knighthode and of fredom flour; fortune him made the heir of hir honour; save wyn and wommen nothing mighte aswage his hye entente in armes and labour;  so was he ful of leonyn corage. what preys were it to him though i yow tolde of darius and an hundred thousand mo of kinges princes erles dukes bolde whiche he conquered and broghte hem into wo?  i seye as fer as man may ryde or go  the world was his what sholde i more devyse? for though i write or tolde you evermo of his knighthode it mighte nat suffyse. twelf yeer he regned as seith machabee;  philippes sone of macedoyne he was that first was king in grece the contree. o worthy gentil alisaundre allas! that ever sholde fallen swich a cas! empoisoned of thyn owene folk thou were;  thy sys fortune hath turned into as;  and yit for thee ne weep she never a tere! who shal me yeven teres to compleyne the deeth of gentillesse and of fraunchyse that al the world welded in his demeyne  and yit him thoughte it mighte nat suffyse? so ful was his corage of heigh empryse. allas! who shal me helpe to endyte false fortune and poison to despyse the whiche two of al this wo i wyte?  de iulio cesare. by wisdom manhede and by greet labour  fro humble bed to royal magestee up roos he iulius the conquerour that wan al thoccident by lond and see by strengthe of hond or elles by tretee  and unto rome made hem tributarie; and sitthe of rome the emperour was he til that fortune wex his adversarie. o mighty cesar that in thessalye ageyn pompeius fader thyn in lawe  that of thorient hadde al the chivalrye  as fer as that the day biginneth dawe thou thurgh thy knighthode hast hem take and slawe save fewe folk that with pompeius fledde thurgh which thou puttest al thorient in awe.  thanke fortune that so wel thee spedde! but now a litel whyl i wol biwaille this pompeius this noble governour of rome which that fleigh at this bataille; i seye oon of his men a fals traitour  his heed of smoot to winnen him favour  of iulius and him the heed he broghte. allas pompey of thorient conquerour that fortune unto swich a fyn thee broghte! to rome ageyn repaireth iulius  with his triumphe laureat ful hye but on a tyme brutus cassius that ever hadde of his hye estaat envye ful prively hath maad conspiracye ageins this iulius in subtil wyse  and cast the place in whiche he sholde dye  with boydekins as i shal yow devyse. this iulius to the capitolie wente upon a day as he was wont to goon and in the capitolie anon him hente  this false brutus and his othere foon and stikede him with boydekins anoon with many a wounde and thus they lete him lye; but never gronte he at no strook but oon or elles at two butif his storie lye.  so manly was this iulius at herte  and so wel lovede estaatly honestee that though his deedly woundes sore smerte his mantel over his hippes casteth he for no man sholde seen his privitee.  and as he lay on deying in a traunce and wiste verraily that deed was he of honestee yit hadde he remembraunce. lucan to thee this storie i recomende and to sweton and to valerie also  that of this storie wryten word and ende  how that to thise grete conqueroures two fortune was first freend and sithen fo. no man ne truste upon hir favour longe but have hir in awayt for evermo.  witnesse on alle thise conqueroures stronge. cresus. this riche cresus whylom king of lyde of whiche cresus cyrus sore him dradde yit was he caught amiddes al his pryde and to be brent men to the fyr him ladde.  but swich a reyn doun fro the welkne shadde  that slow the fyr and made him to escape; but to be war no grace yet he hadde til fortune on the galwes made him gape. whan he escaped was he can nat stente  for to biginne a newe werre agayn. he wende wel for that fortune him sente swich hap that he escaped thurgh the rayn that of his foos he mighte nat be slayn; and eek a sweven upon a night he mette  of which he was so proud and eek so fayn  that in vengeaunce he al his herte sette. upon a tree he was as that him thoughte ther iuppiter him wesh bothe bak and syde and phebus eek a fair towaille him broughte  to drye him with and therfor wex his pryde; and to his doghter that stood him bisyde which that he knew in heigh science habounde he bad hir telle him what it signifyde and she his dreem bigan right thus expounde.  the tree quod she the galwes is to mene  and iuppiter bitokneth snow and reyn and phebus with his towaille so clene tho ben the sonne stremes for to seyn; thou shalt anhanged be fader certeyn;  reyn shal thee wasshe and sonne shal thee drye; thus warned she him ful plat and ful pleyn his doughter which that called was phanye. anhanged was cresus the proude king his royal trone mighte him nat availle.  tragedie is noon other maner thing  ne can in singing crye ne biwaille but for that fortune alwey wol assaille with unwar strook the regnes that ben proude; for when men trusteth hir than wol she faille  and covere hir brighte face with a cloude. explicit tragedia. here stinteth the knight the monk of his tale. the prologue of the nonne preestes tale. ho! quod the knight good sir namore of this that ye han seyd is right ynough ywis and mochel more; for litel hevinesse is right ynough to mochel folk i gesse.  i seye for me it is a greet disese wheras men han ben in greet welthe and ese to heren of hir sodeyn fal allas! and the contrarie is ioie and greet solas as whan a man hath been in povre estaat  and clymbeth up and wexeth fortunat  and ther abydeth in prosperitee swich thing is gladsom as it thinketh me and of swich thing were goodly for to telle. ye quod our hoste by seint poules belle  ye seye right sooth; this monk he clappeth loude he spak how fortune covered with a cloude i noot never what and als of a tragedie right now ye herde and parde! no remedie it is for to biwaille ne compleyne  that that is doon and als it is a peyne  as ye han seyd to here of hevinesse. sir monk namore of this so god yow blesse! your tale anoyeth al this companye; swich talking is nat worth a boterflye;  for therin is ther no desport ne game. wherfor sir monk or dan piers by your name i preye yow hertely telle us somwhat elles for sikerly nere clinking of your belles that on your brydel hange on every syde  by heven king that for us alle dyde  i sholde er this han fallen doun for slepe although the slough had never been so depe; than had your tale al be told in vayn. for certeinly as that thise clerkes seyn  wheras a man may have noon audience noght helpeth it to tellen his sentence. and wel i woot the substance is in me if any thing shal wel reported be. sir sey somwhat of hunting i yow preye.  nay quod this monk i have no lust to pleye;  now let another telle as i have told. than spak our host with rude speche and bold and seyde unto the nonnes preest anon com neer thou preest com hider thou sir iohn  tel us swich thing as may our hertes glade be blythe though thou ryde upon a iade. what though thyn hors be bothe foule and lene if he wol serve thee rekke nat a bene; look that thyn herte be mery evermo.  yis sir quod he yis host so mote i go  but i be mery ywis i wol be blamed: and right anon his tale he hath attamed and thus he seyde unto us everichon this swete preest this goodly man sir iohn.  explicit. here biginneth the nonne preestes tale of the cok and hen chauntecleer and pertelote. a povre widwe somdel stape in age was whylom dwelling in a narwe cotage bisyde a grove stonding in a dale. this widwe of which i telle yow my tale sin thilke day that she was last a wyf  in pacience ladde a ful simple lyf for litel was hir catel and hir rente; by housbondrye of such as god hir sente she fond hirself and eek hir doghtren two. three large sowes hadde she and namo  three kyn and eek a sheep that highte malle.  ful sooty was hir bour and eek hir halle in which she eet ful many a sclendre meel. of poynaunt sauce hir neded never a deel. no deyntee morsel passed thurgh hir throte;  hir dyete was accordant to hir cote. repleccioun ne made hir never syk; attempree dyete was al hir phisyk and exercyse and hertes suffisaunce. the goute lette hir nothing for to daunce  napoplexye shente nat hir heed;  no wyn ne drank she neither whyt ne reed; hir bord was served most with whyt and blak milk and broun breed in which she fond no lak seynd bacoun and somtyme an ey or tweye  for she was as it were a maner deye. a yerd she hadde enclosed al aboute with stikkes and a drye dich withoute in which she hadde a cok hight chauntecleer in al the land of crowing nas his peer.  his vois was merier than the mery orgon  on messedayes that in the chirche gon; wel sikerer was his crowing in his logge than is a clokke or an abbey orlogge. by nature knew he ech ascencioun  of equinoxial in thilke toun; for whan degrees fiftene were ascended thanne crew he that it mighte nat ben amended. his comb was redder than the fyn coral and batailed as it were a castelwal.  his bile was blak and as the ieet it shoon;  lyk asur were his legges and his toon; his nayles whytter than the lilie flour and lyk the burned gold was his colour. this gentil cok hadde in his governaunce  sevene hennes for to doon al his plesaunce whiche were his sustres and his paramours and wonder lyk to him as of colours. of whiche the faireste hewed on hir throte was cleped faire damoysele pertelote.  curteys she was discreet and debonaire  and compaignable and bar hirself so faire sin thilke day that she was seven night old that trewely she hath the herte in hold of chauntecleer loken in every lith;  he loved hir so that wel was him therwith. but such a ioye was it to here hem singe whan that the brighte sonne gan to springe in swete accord my lief is faren in londe. for thilke tyme as i have understonde  bestes and briddes coude speke and singe.  and so bifel that in a daweninge as chauntecleer among his wyves alle sat on his perche that was in the halle and next him sat this faire pertelote  this chauntecleer gan gronen in his throte as man that in his dreem is drecched sore. and whan that pertelote thus herde him rore she was agast and seyde o herte dere what eyleth yow to grone in this manere?  ye been a verray sleper fy for shame!  and he answerde and seyde thus madame i pray yow that ye take it nat agrief: by god me mette i was in swich meschief right now that yet myn herte is sore afright.  now god quod he my swevene recche aright and keep my body out of foul prisoun! me mette how that i romed up and doun withinne our yerde wheras i saugh a beste was lyk an hound and wolde han maad areste  upon my body and wolde han had me deed.  his colour was bitwixe yelwe and reed; and tipped was his tail and bothe his eres with blak unlyk the remenant of his heres; his snowte smal with glowinge eyen tweye.  yet of his look for fere almost i deye; this caused me my groning doutelees. avoy! quod she fy on yow hertelees! allas! quod she for by that god above now han ye lost myn herte and al my love;  i can nat love a coward by my feith.  for certes what so any womman seith we alle desyren if it mighte be to han housbondes hardy wyse and free and secree and no nigard ne no fool  ne him that is agast of every tool ne noon avauntour by that god above! how dorste ye seyn for shame unto your love that any thing mighte make yow aferd? have ye no mannes herte and han a berd?  allas! and conne ye been agast of swevenis?  nothing god wot but vanitee in sweven is. swevenes engendren of replecciouns and ofte of fume and of complecciouns whan humours been to habundant in a wight.  certes this dreem which ye han met tonight cometh of the grete superfluitee of youre rede colera pardee which causeth folk to dreden in here dremes of arwes and of fyr with rede lemes  of grete bestes that they wol hem byte  of contek and of whelpes grete and lyte; right as the humour of malencolye causeth ful many a man in sleep to crye for fere of blake beres or boles blake  or elles blake develes wole hem take. of othere humours coude i telle also that werken many a man in sleep ful wo; but i wol passe as lightly as i can. lo catoun which that was so wys a man  seyde he nat thus ne do no fors of dremes?  now sire quod she whan we flee fro the bemes for goddes love as tak som laxatyf; up peril of my soule and of my lyf i counseille yow the beste i wol nat lye  that bothe of colere and of malencolye ye purge yow; and for ye shul nat tarie though in this toun is noon apotecarie i shal myself to herbes techen yow that shul ben for your hele and for your prow;  and in our yerd tho herbes shal i finde  the whiche han of hir propretee by kinde to purgen yow binethe and eek above. forget not this for goddes owene love! ye been ful colerik of compleccioun.  ware the sonne in his ascencioun ne fynde yow nat repleet of humours hote; and if it do i dar wel leye a grote that ye shul have a fevere terciane or an agu that may be youre bane.  a day or two ye shul have digestyves  of wormes er ye take your laxatyves of lauriol centaure and fumetere or elles of ellebor that groweth there of catapuce or of gaytres beryis  of erbe yve growing in our yerd that mery is; pekke hem up right as they growe and ete hem in. be mery housbond for your fader kin! dredeth no dreem; i can say yow namore. madame quod he graunt mercy of your lore.  but nathelees as touching daun catoun  that hath of wisdom such a greet renoun though that he bad no dremes for to drede by god men may in olde bokes rede of many a man more of auctoritee  than ever catoun was so mote i thee than al the revers seyn of his sentence and han wel founden by experience that dremes ben significaciouns as wel of ioye as tribulaciouns  that folk enduren in this lyf present.  ther nedeth make of this noon argument; the verray preve sheweth it in dede. oon of the gretteste auctours that men rede seith thus that whylom two felawes wente  on pilgrimage in a ful good entente; and happed so thay come into a toun wheras ther was swich congregacioun of peple and eek so streit of herbergage that they ne founde as muche as o cotage  in which they bothe mighte ylogged be.  wherfor thay mosten of necessitee as for that night departen compaignye; and ech of hem goth to his hostelrye and took his logging as it wolde falle.  that oon of hem was logged in a stalle fer in a yerd with oxen of the plough; that other man was logged wel ynough as was his aventure or his fortune that us governeth alle as in commune.  and so bifel that longe er it were day  this man mette in his bed theras he lay how that his felawe gan upon him calle and seyde allas! for in an oxes stalle this night i shal be mordred ther i lye.  now help me dere brother er i dye; in alle haste com to me he sayde. this man out of his sleep for fere abrayde; but whan that he was wakned of his sleep he turned him and took of this no keep;  him thoughte his dreem nas but a vanitee.  thus twyes in his sleping dremed he. and atte thridde tyme yet his felawe cam as him thoughte and seide i am now slawe; bihold my blody woundes depe and wyde!  arys up erly in the morwetyde and at the west gate of the toun quod he a carte ful of donge ther shaltow see in which my body is hid ful prively; do thilke carte aresten boldely.  my gold caused my mordre sooth to sayn;  and tolde him every poynt how he was slayn with a ful pitous face pale of hewe. and truste wel his dreem he fond ful trewe; for on the morwe as sone as it was day  to his felawes in he took the way; and whan that he cam to this oxes stalle after his felawe he bigan to calle. the hostiler answered him anon and seyde sire your felawe is agon  as sone as day he wente out of the toun.  this man gan fallen in suspecioun remembring on his dremes that he mette and forth he goth no lenger wolde he lette unto the west gate of the toun and fond  a dongcarte as it were to donge lond that was arrayed in the same wyse as ye han herd the dede man devyse; and with an hardy herte he gan to crye vengeaunce and iustice of this felonye:  my felawe mordred is this same night  and in this carte he lyth gapinge upright. i crye out on the ministres quod he that sholden kepe and reulen this citee; harrow! allas! her lyth my felawe slayn!  what sholde i more unto this tale sayn? the peple outsterte and caste the cart to grounde and in the middel of the dong they founde the dede man that mordred was al newe. o blisful god that art so iust and trewe!  lo how that thou biwreyest mordre alway!  mordre wol out that see we day by day. mordre is so wlatsom and abhominable to god that is so iust and resonable that he ne wol nat suffre it heled be;  though it abyde a yeer or two or three mordre wol out this my conclusioun. and right anoon ministres of that toun han hent the carter and so sore him pyned and eek the hostiler so sore engyned  that thay biknewe hir wikkednesse anoon  and were anhanged by the nekkeboon. here may men seen that dremes been to drede. and certes in the same book i rede right in the nexte chapitre after this  i gabbe nat so have i ioye or blis two men that wolde han passed over see for certeyn cause into a fer contree if that the wind ne hadde been contrarie that made hem in a citee for to tarie  that stood ful mery upon an havensyde.  but on a day agayn the eventyde the wind gan chaunge and blew right as hem leste. iolif and glad they wente unto hir reste and casten hem ful erly for to saille;  but to that oo man fil a greet mervaille. that oon of hem in sleping as he lay him mette a wonder dreem agayn the day; him thoughte a man stood by his beddes syde and him comaunded that he sholde abyde  and seyde him thus if thou tomorwe wende  thou shalt be dreynt; my tale is at an ende. he wook and tolde his felawe what he mette and preyde him his viage for to lette; as for that day he preyde him to abyde.  his felawe that lay by his beddes syde gan for to laughe and scorned him ful faste. no dreem quod he may so myn herte agaste that i wol lette for to do my thinges. i sette not a straw by thy dreminges  for swevenes been but vanitees and iapes.  men dreme alday of owles or of apes and eke of many a mase therwithal; men dreme of thing that nevere was ne shal. but sith i see that thou wolt heer abyde  and thus forsleuthen wilfully thy tyde god wot it reweth me; and have good day. and thus he took his leve and wente his way. but er that he hadde halfe his cours yseyled noot i nat why ne what mischaunce it eyled  but casuelly the shippes botme rente  and ship and man under the water wente in sighte of othere shippes it byside that with hem seyled at the same tyde. and therfor faire pertelote so dere  by swiche ensamples olde maistow lere that no man sholde been to recchelees of dremes for i sey thee doutelees that many a dreem ful sore is for to drede. lo in the lyf of seint kenelm i rede  that was kenulphus sone the noble king  of mercenrike how kenelm mette a thing; a lyte er he was mordred on a day his mordre in his avisioun he say. his norice him expouned every del  his sweven and bad him for to kepe him wel for traisoun; but he nas but seven yeer old and therfore litel tale hath he told of any dreem so holy was his herte. by god i hadde lever than my sherte  that ye had rad his legende as have i.  dame pertelote i sey yow trewely macrobeus that writ the avisioun in affrike of the worthy cipioun affermeth dremes and seith that they been  warning of thinges that men after seen. and forthermore i pray yow loketh wel in the olde testament of daniel if he held dremes any vanitee. reed eek of ioseph and ther shul ye see  wher dremes ben somtyme i sey nat alle  warning of thinges that shul after falle. loke of egipt the king daun pharao his bakere and his boteler also wher they ne felte noon effect in dremes.  whoso wol seken actes of sondry remes may rede of dremes many a wonder thing. lo cresus which that was of lyde king mette he nat that he sat upon a tree which signified he sholde anhanged be?  lo heer andromacha ectores wyf  that day that ector sholde lese his lyf she dremed on the same night biforn how that the lyf of ector sholde be lorn if thilke day he wente into bataille;  she warned him but it mighte nat availle; he wente for to fighte nathelees but he was slayn anoon of achilles. but thilke tale is al to long to telle and eek it is ny day i may nat dwelle.  shortly i seye as for conclusioun  that i shal han of this avisioun adversitee; and i seye forthermore that i ne telle of laxatyves no store for they ben venimous i woot it wel;  i hem defye i love hem never a del. now let us speke of mirthe and stinte al this; madame pertelote so have i blis of o thing god hath sent me large grace; for whan i see the beautee of your face  ye ben so scarletreed about your yen  it maketh al my drede for to dyen; for also siker as in principio mulier est hominis confusio; madame the sentence of this latin is  womman is mannes ioye and al his blis. for whan i fele anight your softe syde albeit that i may nat on you ryde for that our perche is maad so narwe alas! i am so ful of ioye and of solas  that i defye bothe sweven and dreem.  and with that word he fley doun fro the beem for it was day and eek his hennes alle; and with a chuk he gan hem for to calle for he had founde a corn lay in the yerd.  royal he was he was namore aferd; he fethered pertelote twenty tyme and trad as ofte er that it was pryme. he loketh as it were a grim leoun; and on his toos he rometh up and doun  him deyned not to sette his foot to grounde.  he chukketh whan he hath a corn yfounde and to him rennen thanne his wyves alle. thus royal as a prince is in his halle leve i this chauntecleer in his pasture;  and after wol i telle his aventure. whan that the month in which the world bigan that highte march whan god first maked man was complet and ypassed were also sin march bigan thritty dayes and two  bifel that chauntecleer in al his pryde  his seven wyves walking by his syde caste up his eyen to the brighte sonne that in the signe of taurus hadde yronne twenty degrees and oon and somwhat more;  and knew by kynde and by noon other lore that it was pryme and crew with blisful stevene. the sonne he sayde is clomben up on hevene fourty degrees and oon and more ywis. madame pertelote my worldes blis  herkneth thise blisful briddes how they singe  and see the fresshe floures how they springe; ful is myn herte of revel and solas. but sodeinly him fil a sorweful cas; for ever the latter ende of ioye is wo.  god woot that worldly ioye is sone ago; and if a rethor coude faire endyte he in a cronique saufly mighte it wryte as for a sovereyn notabilitee. now every wys man lat him herkne me;  this storie is also trewe i undertake  as is the book of launcelot de lake that wommen holde in ful gret reverence. now wol i torne agayn to my sentence. a colfox ful of sly iniquitee  that in the grove hadde woned yeres three by heigh imaginacioun forncast the same night thurghout the hegges brast into the yerd ther chauntecleer the faire was wont and eek his wyves to repaire;  and in a bed of wortes stille he lay  til it was passed undern of the day wayting his tyme on chauntecleer to falle as gladly doon thise homicydes alle that in awayt liggen to mordre men.  o false mordrer lurking in thy den! o newe scariot newe genilon! false dissimilour o greek sinon that broghtest troye al outrely to sorwe! o chauntecleer acursed be that morwe  that thou into that yerd flough fro the bemes!  thou were ful wel ywarned by thy dremes that thilke day was perilous to thee. but what that god forwoot mot nedes be after the opinioun of certeyn clerkis.  witnesse on him that any perfit clerk is that in scole is gret altercacioun in this matere and greet disputisoun and hath ben of an hundred thousand men. but i ne can not bulte it to the bren  as can the holy doctour augustyn  or boece or the bishop bradwardyn whether that goddes worthy forwiting streyneth me nedely for to doon a thing nedely clepe i simple necessitee;  or elles if free choys be graunted me to do that same thing or do it noght though god forwoot it er that it was wroght; or if his witing streyneth nevere a del but by necessitee condicionel.  i wol not han to do of swich matere;  my tale is of a cok as ye may here that took his counseil of his wyf with sorwe to walken in the yerd upon that morwe that he had met the dreem that i yow tolde.  wommennes counseils been ful ofte colde; wommannes counseil broghte us first to wo and made adam fro paradys to go theras he was ful mery and wel at ese. but for i noot to whom it mighte displese  if i counseil of wommen wolde blame  passe over for i seyde it in my game. rede auctours wher they trete of swich matere and what thay seyn of wommen ye may here. thise been the cokkes wordes and nat myne;  i can noon harm of no womman divyne. faire in the sond to bathe hir merily lyth pertelote and alle hir sustres by agayn the sonne; and chauntecleer so free song merier than the mermayde in the see;  for phisiologus seith sikerly  how that they singen wel and merily. and so bifel that as he caste his ye among the wortes on a boterflye he was war of this fox that lay ful lowe.  nothing ne liste him thanne for to crowe but cryde anon cok cok and up he sterte as man that was affrayed in his herte. for naturelly a beest desyreth flee fro his contrarie if he may it see  though he never erst had seyn it with his ye.  this chauntecleer whan he gan him espye he wolde han fled but that the fox anon seyde gentil sire allas! wher wol ye gon? be ye affrayed of me that am your freend?  now certes i were worse than a feend if i to yow wolde harm or vileinye. i am nat come your counseil for tespye; but trewely the cause of my cominge was only for to herkne how that ye singe.  for trewely ye have as mery a stevene  as eny aungel hath that is in hevene; therwith ye han in musik more felinge than hadde boece or any that can singe. my lord your fader god his soule blesse!  and eek your moder of hir gentilesse han in myn hous ybeen to my gret ese; and certes sire ful fayn wolde i yow plese. but for men speke of singing i wol saye so mote i brouke wel myn eyen tweye  save yow i herde never man so singe l as dide your fader in the morweninge; certes it was of herte al that he song. and for to make his voys the more strong he wolde so peyne him that with bothe his yen  he moste winke so loude he wolde cryen and stonden on his tiptoon therwithal and strecche forth his nekke long and smal. and eek he was of swich discrecioun that ther nas no man in no regioun  that him in song or wisdom mighte passe.  i have wel rad in daun burnel the asse among his vers how that ther was a cok for that a preestes sone yaf him a knok upon his leg whyl he was yong and nyce  he made him for to lese his benefyce. but certeyn ther nis no comparisoun bitwix the wisdom and discrecioun of youre fader and of his subtiltee. now singeth sire for seinte charitee  let see conne ye your fader countrefete?  this chauntecleer his winges gan to bete as man that coude his tresoun nat espye so was he ravisshed with his flaterye. allas! ye lordes many a fals flatour  is in your courtes and many a losengeour that plesen yow wel more by my feith than he that soothfastnesse unto yow seith. redeth ecclesiaste of flaterye; beth war ye lordes of hir trecherye.  this chauntecleer stood hye upon his toos  strecching his nekke and heeld his eyen cloos and gan to crowe loude for the nones; and daun russel the fox sterte up at ones and by the gargat hente chauntecleer  and on his bak toward the wode him beer for yet ne was ther no man that him sewed. o destinee that mayst nat been eschewed! allas that chauntecleer fleigh fro the bemes! allas his wyf ne roghte nat of dremes!  and on a friday fil al this meschaunce.  o venus that art goddesse of plesaunce sin that thy servant was this chauntecleer and in thy service dide al his poweer more for delyt than world to multiplye  why woldestow suffre him on thy day to dye? o gaufred dere mayster soverayn that whan thy worthy king richard was slayn with shot compleynedest his deth so sore why ne hadde i now thy sentence and thy lore  the friday for to chyde as diden ye?  for on a friday soothly slayn was he. than wolde i shewe yow how that i coude pleyne for chauntecleres drede and for his peyne. certes swich cry ne lamentacioun  was never of ladies maad whan ilioun was wonne and pirrus with his streite swerd whan he hadde hent king priam by the berd and slayn him as saith us eneydos as maden alle the hennes in the clos  whan they had seyn of chauntecleer the sighte.  but sovereynly dame pertelote shrighte ful louder than dide hasdrubales wyf whan that hir housbond hadde lost his lyf and that the romayns hadde brend cartage;  she was so ful of torment and of rage that wilfully into the fyr she sterte and brende hirselven with a stedfast herte. o woful hennes right so cryden ye as whan that nero brende the citee  of rome cryden senatoures wyves  for that hir housbondes losten alle hir lyves; withouten gilt this nero hath hem slayn. now wol i torne to my tale agayn: this sely widwe and eek hir doghtres two  herden thise hennes crye and maken wo and out at dores sterten they anoon and syen the fox toward the grove goon and bar upon his bak the cok away; and cryden out! harrow! and weylaway!  ha ha the fox! and after him they ran  and eek with staves many another man; ran colle our dogge and talbot and gerland and malkin with a distaf in hir hand; ran cow and calf and eek the verray hogges  so were they fered for berking of the dogges and shouting of the men and wimmen eke they ronne so hem thoughte hir herte breke. they yelleden as feendes doon in helle; the dokes cryden as men wolde hem quelle;  the gees for fere flowen over the trees;  out of the hyve cam the swarm of bees; so hidous was the noyse a! benedicite! certes he iakke straw and his meynee ne made never shoutes half so shrille  whan that they wolden any fleming kille as thilke day was maad upon the fox. of bras thay broghten bemes and of box of horn of boon in whiche they blewe and pouped and therwithal thay shryked and they houped;  it semed as that heven sholde falle.  now gode men i pray yow herkneth alle! lo how fortune turneth sodeinly the hope and pryde eek of hir enemy! this cok that lay upon the foxes bak  in al his drede unto the fox he spak and seyde sire if that i were as ye yet sholde i seyn as wis god helpe me turneth agayn ye proude cherles alle! a verray pestilence upon yow falle!  now am i come unto this wodes syde  maugree your heed the cok shal heer abyde; i wol him ete in feith and that anon. the fox answerde in feith it shal be don and as he spak that word al sodeinly  this cok brak from his mouth deliverly and heighe upon a tree he fleigh anon. and whan the fox saugh that he was ygon allas! quod he o chauntecleer allas! i have to yow quod he ydoon trespas  inasmuche as i maked yow aferd  whan i yow hente and broghte out of the yerd; but sire i dide it in no wikke entente; com doun and i shal telle yow what i mente. i shal seye sooth to yow god help me so.  nay than quod he i shrewe us bothe two and first i shrewe myself bothe blood and bones if thou bigyle me ofter than ones. thou shalt namore thurgh thy flaterye do me to singe and winke with myn ye.  for he that winketh whan he sholde see  al wilfully god lat him never thee! nay quod the fox but god yeve him meschaunce that is so undiscreet of governaunce that iangleth whan he sholde holde his pees.  lo swich it is for to be recchelees and necligent and truste on flaterye. but ye that holden this tale a folye as of a fox or of a cok and hen taketh the moralitee good men.  for seint paul seith that al that writen is  to our doctryne it is ywrite ywis. taketh the fruyt and lat the chaf be stille. now gode god if that it be thy wille as seith my lord so make us alle good men;  and bringe us to his heighe blisse. amen. here is ended the nonne preestes tale. sir nonnes preest our hoste seyde anoon yblessed be thy breche and every stoon! this was a mery tale of chauntecleer. but by my trouthe if thou were seculer  thou woldest been a tredefoul aright. for if thou have corage as thou hast might thee were nede of hennes as i wene ya mo than seven tymes seventene. see whiche braunes hath this gentil preest  so greet a nekke and swich a large breest!  he loketh as a sperhauk with his yen; him nedeth nat his colour for to dyen with brasil ne with greyn of portingale. now sire faire falle yow for youre tale!  and after that he with ful mery chere seide to another as ye shullen here. ye let that passen quod our hoste as now. sire doctour of phisyk i preye yow telle us a tale of som honest matere. it shal be doon if that ye wol it here seyde this doctour and his tale bigan anon. now good men quod he herkneth everichon. here folweth the phisiciens tale. ther was as telleth titus livius a knight that called was virginius fulfild of honour and of worthinesse and strong of freendes and of greet richesse. this knight a doghter hadde by his wyf  no children hadde he mo in al his lyf. fair was this mayde in excellent beautee aboven every wight that man may see; for nature hath with sovereyn diligence yformed hir in so greet excellence  as though she wolde seyn lo! i nature thus can i forme and peynte a creature whan that me list; who can me countrefete? pigmalion noght though he ay forge and bete or grave or peynte; for i dar wel seyn  apelles zanzis sholde werche in veyn outher to grave or peynte or forge or bete if they presumed me to countrefete. for he that is the former principal hath maked me his vicaire general  to forme and peynten erthely creaturis right as me list and ech thing in my cure is under the mone that may wane and waxe and for my werk right nothing wol i axe; my lord and i ben ful of oon accord;  i made hir to the worship of my lord. so do i alle myne othere creatures what colour that they han or what figures. thus semeth me that nature wolde seye. this mayde of age twelf yeer was and tweye  in which that nature hadde swich delyt. for right as she can peynte a lilie whyt and reed a rose right with swich peynture she peynted hath this noble creature er she were born upon hir limes free  wheras by right swiche colours sholde be; and phebus dyed hath hir tresses grete lyk to the stremes of his burned hete. and if that excellent was hir beautee a thousandfold more vertuous was she.  in hir ne lakked no condicioun that is to preyse as by discrecioun. as wel in goost as body chast was she; for which she floured in virginitee with alle humilitee and abstinence  with alle attemperaunce and pacience with mesure eek of bering and array. discreet she was in answering alway; though she were wys as pallas dar i seyn hir facound eek ful wommanly and pleyn  no countrefeted termes hadde she to seme wys; but after hir degree she spak and alle hir wordes more and lesse souninge in vertu and in gentillesse. shamfast she was in maydens shamfastnesse  constant in herte and ever in bisinesse to dryve hir out of ydel slogardye. bacus hadde of hir mouth right no maistrye; for wyn and youthe doon venus encrece as men in fyr wol casten oile or grece.  and of hir owene vertu unconstreyned she hath ful ofte tyme syk hir feyned for that she wolde fleen the companye wher lykly was to treten of folye as is at festes revels and at daunces  that been occasions of daliaunces. swich thinges maken children for to be to sone rype and bold as men may see which is ful perilous and hath ben yore. for al to sone may she lerne lore  of boldnesse whan she woxen is a wyf. and ye maistresses in your olde lyf that lordes doghtres han in governaunce ne taketh of my wordes no displesaunce; thenketh that ye ben set in governinges  of lordes doghtres only for two thinges; outher for ye han kept your honestee or elles ye han falle in freletee and knowen wel ynough the olde daunce and han forsaken fully swich meschaunce  for evermo; therfore for cristes sake to teche hem vertu loke that ye ne slake. a theef of venisoun that hath forlaft his likerousnesse and al his olde craft can kepe a forest best of any man.  now kepeth hem wel for if ye wol ye can; loke wel that ye unto no vice assente lest ye be dampned for your wikke entente; for whoso doth a traitour is certeyn. and taketh kepe of that that i shal seyn;  of alle tresons sovereyn pestilence is whan a wight bitrayseth innocence. ye fadres and ye modres eek also though ye han children be it oon or two your is the charge of al hir surveyaunce  whyl that they been under your governaunce. beth war that by ensample of your livinge or by your necligence in chastisinge that they ne perisse; for i dar wel seye if that they doon ye shul it dere abeye.  under a shepherde softe and necligent the wolf hath many a sheep and lamb torent. suffyseth oon ensample now as here for i mot turne agayn to my matere. this mayde of which i wol this tale expresse  so kepte hirself hir neded no maistresse; for in hir living maydens mighten rede as in a book every good word or dede that longeth to a mayden vertuous; she was so prudent and so bountevous.  for which the fame outsprong on every syde bothe of hir beautee and hir bountee wyde; that thurgh that land they preysed hir echone that loved vertu save envye allone that sory is of other mennes wele  and glad is of his sorwe and his unhele; the doctour maketh this descripcioun. this mayde upon a day wente in the toun toward a temple with hir moder dere as is of yonge maydens the manere.  now was ther thanne a iustice in that toun that governour was of that regioun. and so bifel this iuge his eyen caste upon this mayde avysinge him ful faste as she cam forby ther this iuge stood.  anon his herte chaunged and his mood so was he caught with beautee of this mayde; and to himself ful prively he sayde this mayde shal be myn for any man. anon the feend into his herte ran  and taughte him sodeynly that he by slighte the mayden to his purpos winne mighte. for certes by no force ne by no mede him thoughte he was nat able for to spede; for she was strong of freendes and eek she  confermed was in swich soverayn bountee that wel he wiste he mighte hir never winne as for to make hir with hir body sinne. for which by greet deliberacioun he sente after a cherl was in the toun  which that he knew for subtil and for bold. this iuge unto this cherl his tale hath told in secree wyse and made him to ensure he sholde telle it to no creature and if he dide he sholde lese his heed.  whan that assented was this cursed reed glad was this iuge and maked him greet chere and yaf hym yiftes preciouse and dere. whan shapen was al hir conspiracye fro point to point how that his lecherye  parfourned sholde been ful subtilly as ye shul here it after openly hoom gooth the cherl that highte claudius. this false iuge that highte apius so was his name for this is no fable  but knowen for historial thing notable the sentence of it sooth is out of doute this false iuge gooth now faste aboute to hasten his delyt al that he may. and so bifel sone after on a day  this false iuge as telleth us the storie as he was wont sat in his consistorie and yaf his domes upon sondry cas. this false cherl cam forth a ful greet pas and seyde lord if that it be your wille  as dooth me right upon this pitous bille in which i pleyne upon virginius. and if that he wol seyn it is nat thus i wol it preve and finde good witnesse that sooth is that my bille wol expresse.  the iuge answerde of this in his absence i may nat yeve diffinitif sentence. lat do him calle and i wol gladly here; thou shall have al right and no wrong here. virginius cam to wite the iuges wille  and right anon was rad this cursed bille; the sentence of it was as ye shul here. to yow my lord sire apius so dere sheweth your povre servant claudius how that a knight called virginius  agayns the lawe agayn al equitee holdeth expres agayn the wil of me my servant which that is my thral by right which fro myn hous was stole upon a night whyl that she was ful yong; this wol i preve  by witnesse lord so that it nat yow greve. she nis his doghter nat what so he seye; wherfore to yow my lord the iuge i preye yeld me my thral if that it be your wille. lo! this was al the sentence of his bille.  virginius gan upon the cherl biholde but hastily er he his tale tolde and wolde have preved it as sholde a knight and eek by witnessing of many a wight that it was fals that seyde his adversarie  this cursed iuge wolde nothing tarie ne here a word more of virginius but yaf his iugement and seyde thus: i deme anon this cherl his servant have; thou shalt no lenger in thyn hous hir save.  go bring hir forth and put hir in our warde the cherl shal have his thral this i awarde. and whan this worthy knight virginius thurgh sentence of this iustice apius moste by force his dere doghter yiven  unto the iuge in lecherye to liven he gooth him hoom and sette him in his halle and leet anon his dere doghter calle and with a face deed as asshen colde upon hir humble face he gan biholde  with fadres pitee stiking thurgh his herte al wolde he from his purpos nat converte. doghter quod he virginia by thy name ther been two weyes outher deeth or shame that thou most suffre; allas! that i was bore!  for never thou deservedest wherfore to dyen with a swerd or with a knyf. o dere doghter ender of my lyf which i have fostred up with swich plesaunce that thou were never out of my remembraunce!  o doghter which that art my laste wo and in my lyf my laste ioye also o gemme of chastitee in pacience take thou thy deeth for this is my sentence. for love and nat for hate thou most be deed;  my pitous hand mot smyten of thyn heed. allas! that ever apius thee say! thus hath he falsly iuged thee today and tolde hir al the cas as ye bifore han herd; nat nedeth for to telle it more.  o mercy dere fader quod this mayde and with that word she both hir armes layde about his nekke as she was wont to do: the teres broste out of hir eyen two and seyde gode fader shal i dye?  is ther no grace? is ther no remedye? no certes dere doghter myn quod he. thanne yif me leyser fader myn quod she my deeth for to compleyne a litel space; for pardee iepte yaf his doghter grace  for to compleyne er he hir slow allas! and god it woot nothing was hir trespas but for she ran hir fader first to see to welcome him with greet solempnitee. and with that word she fil aswowne anon  and after whan hir swowning is agon she ryseth up and to hir fader sayde blessed be god that i shal dye a mayde. yif me my deeth er that i have a shame; doth with your child your wil a goddes name!  and with that word she preyed him ful ofte that with his swerd he wolde smyte softe and with that word aswowne doun she fil. hir fader with ful sorweful herte and wil hir heed of smoot and by the top it hente  and to the iuge he gan it to presente as he sat yet in doom in consistorie. and whan the iuge it saugh as seith the storie he bad to take him and anhange him faste. but right anon a thousand peple in thraste  to save the knight for routhe and for pitee for knowen was the false iniquitee. the peple anon hath suspect of this thing by manere of the cherles chalanging that it was by the assent of apius;  they wisten wel that he was lecherous. for which unto this apius they gon and caste him in a prison right anon wheras he slow himself; and claudius that servant was unto this apius  was demed for to hange upon a tree; but that virginius of his pitee so preyde for him that he was exyled; and elles certes he had been bigyled. the remenant were anhanged more and lesse  that were consentant of this cursednesse. heer men may seen how sinne hath his meryte! beth war for no man woot whom god wol smyte in no degree ne in which maner wyse the worm of conscience may agryse  of wikked lyf though it so privee be that no man woot therof but god and he. for be he lewed man or elles lered he noot how sone that he shal been afered. therfore i rede yow this conseil take  forsaketh sinne er sinne yow forsake. here endeth the phisiciens tale. the wordes of the host to the phisicien and the pardoner. our hoste gan to swere as he were wood harrow! quod he by nayles and by blood!. this was a fals cherl and a fals iustyse! as shamful deeth as herte may devyse  come to thise iuges and hir advocats! algate this sely mayde is slayn allas! allas! to dere boghte she beautee! wherfore i seye al day as men may see that yiftes of fortune or of nature  ben cause of deeth to many a creature.  hir beautee was hir deeth i dar wel sayn; allas! so pitously as she was slayn! of bothe yiftes that i speke of now men han ful ofte more harm than prow.  but trewely myn owene mayster dere this is a pitous tale for to here. but natheles passe over is no fors; i prey to god so save thy gentil cors and eek thyne urinals and thy iordanes  thyn ypocras and eek thy galianes  and every boist ful of thy letuarie; god blesse hem and our lady seinte marie! so mot i theen thou art a propre man and lyk a prelat by seint ronyan!  seyde i nat wel? i can nat speke in terme; but wel i woot thou doost my herte to erme that i almost have caught a cardiacle. by corpus bones! but i have triacle or elles a draught of moyste and corny ale  or but i here anon a mery tale  myn herte is lost for pitee of this mayde. thou bel amy thou pardoner he seyde tel us som mirthe or iapes right anon. it shall be doon quod he by seint ronyon!  but first quod he heer at this alestake i wol both drinke and eten of a cake. but right anon thise gentils gonne to crye nay! lat him telle us of no ribaudye; tel us som moral thing that we may lere  som wit and thanne wol we gladly here.  i graunte ywis quod he but i mot thinke upon som honest thing whyl that i drinke. here folweth the prologe of the pardoners tale. radix malorum est cupiditas: ad thimotheum sexto. lordings quod he in chirches whan i preche i peyne me to han an hauteyn speche  and ringe it out as round as gooth a belle for i can al by rote that i telle. my theme is alwey oon and ever was radix malorum est cupiditas. first i pronounce whennes that i come  and than my bulles shewe i alle and somme. our lige lordes seel on my patente that shewe i first my body to warente  that no man be so bold ne preest ne clerk me to destourbe of cristes holy werk;  and after that than telle i forth my tales bulles of popes and of cardinales of patriarkes and bishoppes i shewe; and in latyn i speke a wordes fewe to saffron with my predicacioun  and for to stire men to devocioun. than shewe i forth my longe cristal stones ycrammed ful of cloutes and of bones;  reliks been they as wenen they echoon. than have i in latoun a sholderboon  which that was of an holy iewes shepe. good men seye i tak of my wordes kepe; if that this boon be wasshe in any welle if cow or calf or sheep or oxe swelle that any worm hath ete or worm ystonge  tak water of that welle and wash his tonge and it is hool anon; and forthermore of pokkes and of scabbe and every sore  shal every sheep be hool that of this welle drinketh a draughte; tak kepe eek what i telle.  if that the goodman that the bestes oweth wol every wike er that the cok him croweth fastinge drinken of this welle a draughte as thilke holy iewe our eldres taughte his bestes and his stoor shal multiplye.  and sirs also it heleth ialousye; for though a man be falle in ialous rage let maken with this water his potage  and never shal he more his wyf mistriste though he the sooth of hir defaute wiste;  al had she taken preestes two or three. heer is a miteyn eek that ye may see. he that his hond wol putte in this miteyn he shal have multiplying of his greyn whan he hath sowen be it whete or otes  so that he offre pens or elles grotes. good men and wommen o thing warne i yow if any wight be in this chirche now  that hath doon sinne horrible that he dar nat for shame of it yshriven be  or any womman be she yong or old that hath ymaad hir housbond cokewold swich folk shul have no power ne no grace to offren to my reliks in this place. and whoso findeth him out of swich blame  he wol com up and offre in goddes name and i assoille him by the auctoritee which that by bulle ygraunted was to me.  by this gaude have i wonne yeer by yeer an hundred mark sith i was pardoner.  i stonde lyk a clerk in my pulpet and whan the lewed peple is doun yset i preche so as ye han herd bifore and telle an hundred false iapes more. than peyne i me to strecche forth the nekke  and est and west upon the peple i bekke as doth a dowve sitting on a berne. myn hondes and my tonge goon so yerne  that it is ioye to see my bisinesse. of avaryce and of swich cursednesse  is al my preching for to make hem free to yeve her pens and namely unto me. for my entente is nat but for to winne and nothing for correccioun of sinne. i rekke never whan that they ben beried  though that her soules goon ablakeberied! for certes many a predicacioun comth ofte tyme of yvel entencioun;  som for plesaunce of folk and flaterye to been avaunced by ipocrisye  and som for veyne glorie and som for hate. for whan i dar non other weyes debate than wol i stinge him with my tonge smerte in preching so that he shal nat asterte to been defamed falsly if that he  hath trespased to my brethren or to me. for though i telle noght his propre name men shal wel knowe that it is the same  by signes and by othere circumstances. thus quyte i folk that doon us displesances;  thus spitte i out my venim under hewe of holynesse to seme holy and trewe. but shortly myn entente i wol devyse; i preche of nothing but for coveityse. therfor my theme is yet and ever was  radix malorum est cupiditas. thus can i preche agayn that same vyce which that i use and that is avaryce.  but though myself be gilty in that sinne yet can i maken other folk to twinne  from avaryce and sore to repente. but that is nat my principal entente. i preche nothing but for coveityse; of this matere it oughte ynogh suffyse. than telle i hem ensamples many oon  of olde stories longe tyme agoon: for lewed peple loven tales olde; swich thinges can they wel reporte and holde.  what? trowe ye the whyles i may preche and winne gold and silver for i teche  that i wol live in povert wilfully? nay nay i thoghte it never trewely! for i wol preche and begge in sondry londes; i wol not do no labour with myn hondes ne make baskettes and live therby  because i wol nat beggen ydelly. i wol non of the apostles counterfete; i wol have money wolle chese and whete  al were it yeven of the povrest page or of the povrest widwe in a village  al sholde hir children sterve for famyne. nay! i wol drinke licour of the vyne and have a ioly wenche in every toun. but herkneth lordings in conclusioun; your lyking is that i shal telle a tale.  now have i dronke a draughte of corny ale by god i hope i shal yow telle a thing that shal by resoun been at your lyking.  for though myself be a ful vicious man a moral tale yet i yow telle can  which i am wont to preche for to winne. now holde your pees my tale i wol beginne. here biginneth the pardoners tale. in flaundres whylom was a companye of yonge folk that haunteden folye as ryot hasard stewes and tavernes  wheras with harpes lutes and giternes they daunce and pleye at dees bothe day and night and ete also and drinken over hir might  thurgh which they doon the devel sacrifyse within that develes temple in cursed wyse  by superfluitee abhominable; hir othes been so grete and so dampnable that it is grisly for to here hem swere; our blissed lordes body they totere; hem thoughte iewes rente him noght ynough;  and ech of hem at otheres sinne lough. and right anon than comen tombesteres fetys and smale and yonge fruytesteres  singers with harpes baudes wafereres whiche been the verray develes officeres  to kindle and blowe the fyr of lecherye that is annexed unto glotonye; the holy writ take i to my witnesse that luxurie is in wyn and dronkenesse. lo how that dronken loth unkindely  lay by his doghtres two unwitingly; so dronke he was he niste what he wroghte. herodes whoso wel the stories soghte  whan he of wyn was replet at his feste right at his owene table he yaf his heste  to sleen the baptist iohn ful giltelees. senek seith eek a good word doutelees; he seith he can no difference finde bitwix a man that is out of his minde and a man which that is dronkelewe  but that woodnesse yfallen in a shrewe persevereth lenger than doth dronkenesse. o glotonye ful of cursednesse  o cause first of our confusioun o original of our dampnacioun  til crist had boght us with his blood agayn! lo how dere shortly for to sayn aboght was thilke cursed vileinye; corrupt was al this world for glotonye! adam our fader and his wyf also  fro paradys to labour and to wo were driven for that vyce it is no drede; for whyl that adam fasted as i rede  he was in paradys; and whan that he eet of the fruyt defended on the tree  anon he was outcast to wo and peyne. o glotonye on thee wel oghte us pleyne! o wiste a man how many maladyes folwen of excesse and of glotonyes he wolde been the more mesurable  of his diete sittinge at his table. allas! the shorte throte the tendre mouth maketh that est and west and north and south  in erthe in eir in water men toswinke to gete a glotoun deyntee mete and drinke!  of this matere o paul wel canstow trete mete unto wombe and wombe eek unto mete shal god destroyen bothe as paulus seith. allas! a foul thing is it by my feith to seye this word and fouler is the dede  whan man so drinketh of the whyte and rede that of his throte he maketh his privee thurgh thilke cursed superfluitee.  the apostel weping seith ful pitously ther walken many of whiche yow told have i  i seye it now weping with pitous voys that they been enemys of cristes croys of whiche the ende is deeth wombe is her god. o wombe! o bely! o stinking cod fulfild of donge and of corrupcioun!  at either ende of thee foul is the soun. how greet labour and cost is thee to finde! thise cokes how they stampe and streyne and grinde  and turnen substaunce into accident to fulfille al thy likerous talent!  out of the harde bones knokke they the mary for they caste noght awey that may go thurgh the golet softe and swote; of spicerye of leef and bark and rote shal been his sauce ymaked by delyt  to make him yet a newer appetyt. but certes he that haunteth swich delyces is deed whyl that he liveth in tho vyces.  a lecherous thing is wyn and dronkenesse is ful of stryving and of wrecchednesse.  o dronke man disfigured is thy face sour is thy breeth foul artow to embrace and thurgh thy dronke nose semeth the soun as though thou seydest ay sampsoun sampsoun; and yet god wot sampsoun drank never no wyn.  thou fallest as it were a stiked swyn; thy tonge is lost and al thyn honest cure; for dronkenesse is verray sepulture  of mannes wit and his discrecioun. in whom that drinke hath dominacioun  he can no conseil kepe it is no drede. now kepe yow fro the whyte and fro the rede and namely fro the whyte wyn of lepe that is to selle in fishstrete or in chepe. this wyn of spayne crepeth subtilly  in othere wynes growing faste by of which ther ryseth swich fumositee that whan a man hath dronken draughtes three  and weneth that he be at hoom in chepe he is in spayne right at the toune of lepe  nat at the rochel ne at burdeux toun; and thanne wol he seye sampsoun sampsoun. but herkneth lordings o word i yow preye that alle the sovereyn actes dar i seye of victories in the olde testament  thurgh verray god that is omnipotent were doon in abstinence and in preyere; loketh the bible and ther ye may it lere.  loke attila the grete conquerour deyde in his sleep with shame and dishonour  bledinge ay at his nose in dronkenesse; a capitayn shoulde live in sobrenesse. and over al this avyseth yow right wel what was comaunded unto lamuel nat samuel but lamuel seye i  redeth the bible and finde it expresly of wynyeving to hem that han iustyse. namore of this for it may wel suffyse.  and now that i have spoke of glotonye now wol i yow defenden hasardrye.  hasard is verray moder of lesinges and of deceite and cursed forsweringes blaspheme of crist manslaughtre and wast also of catel and of tyme; and forthermo it is repreve and contrarie of honour  for to ben holde a commune hasardour. and ever the hyer he is of estaat the more is he holden desolaat.  if that a prince useth hasardrye in alle governaunce and policye  he is as by commune opinioun yholde the lasse in reputacioun. stilbon that was a wys embassadour was sent to corinthe in ful greet honour fro lacidomie to make hir alliaunce.  and whan he cam him happede par chaunce that alle the grettest that were of that lond pleyinge atte hasard he hem fond.  for which as sone as it mighte be he stal him hoom agayn to his contree  and seyde ther wol i nat lese my name; ne i wol nat take on me so greet defame yow for to allye unto none hasardours. sendeth othere wyse embassadours; for by my trouthe me were lever dye  than i yow sholde to hasardours allye. for ye that been so glorious in honours shul nat allyen yow with hasardours  as by my wil ne as by my tretee. this wyse philosophre thus seyde he.  loke eek that to the king demetrius the king of parthes as the book seith us sente him a paire of dees of gold in scorn for he hadde used hasard therbiforn; for which he heeld his glorie or his renoun  at no value or reputacioun. lordes may finden other maner pley honeste ynough to dryve the day awey.  now wol i speke of othes false and grete a word or two as olde bokes trete.  gret swering is a thing abhominable and false swering is yet more reprevable. the heighe god forbad swering at al witnesse on mathew; but in special of swering seith the holy ieremye  thou shalt seye sooth thyn othes and nat lye and swere in dome and eek in rightwisnesse; but ydel swering is a cursednesse.  bihold and see that in the firste table of heighe goddes hestes honurable  how that the seconde heste of him is this tak nat my name in ydel or amis. lo rather he forbedeth swich swering than homicyde or many a cursed thing; i seye that as by ordre thus it stondeth;  this knowen that his hestes understondeth how that the second heste of god is that. and forther over i wol thee telle al plat  that vengeance shal nat parten from his hous that of his othes is to outrageous.  by goddes precious herte and by his nayles and by the blode of crist that it is in hayles seven is my chaunce and thyn is cink and treye; by goddes armes if thou falsly pleye this dagger shal thurghout thyn herte go  this fruyt cometh of the bicched bones two forswering ire falsnesse homicyde. now for the love of crist that for us dyde  leveth your othes bothe grete and smale; but sirs now wol i telle forth my tale.  thise ryotoures three of whiche i telle longe erst er pryme rong of any belle were set hem in a taverne for to drinke; and as they satte they herde a belle clinke biforn a cors was caried to his grave;  that oon of hem gan callen to his knave go bet quod he and axe redily what cors is this that passeth heer forby;  and look that thou reporte his name wel. sir quod this boy it nedeth neveradel.  it was me told er ye cam heer two houres; he was pardee an old felawe of youres; and sodeynly he was yslayn tonight fordronke as he sat on his bench upright; ther cam a privee theef men clepeth deeth  that in this contree al the peple sleeth and with his spere he smoot his herte atwo and wente his wey withouten wordes mo.  he hath a thousand slayn this pestilence: and maister er ye come in his presence  me thinketh that it were necessarie for to be war of swich an adversarie: beth redy for to mete him evermore. thus taughte me my dame i sey namore. by seinte marie seyde this taverner  the child seith sooth for he hath slayn this yeer henne over a myle within a greet village both man and womman child and hyne and page.  i trowe his habitacioun be there; to been avysed greet wisdom it were  er that he dide a man a dishonour. ye goddes armes quod this ryotour is it swich peril with him for to mete? i shal him seke by wey and eek by strete i make avow to goddes digne bones!  herkneth felawes we three been al ones; lat ech of us holde up his hond til other  and ech of us bicomen otheres brother and we wol sleen this false traytour deeth; he shal be slayn which that so many sleeth  by goddes dignitee er it be night. togidres han thise three her trouthes plight to live and dyen ech of hem for other as though he were his owene yboren brother. and up they sterte al dronken in this rage  and forth they goon towardes that village of which the taverner had spoke biforn and many a grisly ooth than han they sworn  and cristes blessed body they torente deeth shal be deed if that they may him hente.  whan they han goon nat fully half a myle right as they wolde han troden over a style an old man and a povre with hem mette. this olde man ful mekely hem grette and seyde thus now lordes god yow see!  the proudest of thise ryotoures three answerde agayn what? carl with sory grace why artow al forwrapped save thy face?  why livestow so longe in so greet age? this olde man gan loke in his visage  and seyde thus for i ne can nat finde a man though that i walked into inde neither in citee nor in no village that wolde chaunge his youthe for myn age; and therfore moot i han myn age stille  as longe time as it is goddes wille. ne deeth allas! ne wol nat han my lyf; thus walke i lyk a restelees caityf  and on the ground which is my modres gate i knokke with my staf bothe erly and late  and seye leve moder leet me in! lo how i vanish flesh and blood and skin! allas! whan shul my bones been at reste? moder with yow wolde i chaunge my cheste that in my chambre longe tyme hath be  ye! for an heyre clout to wrappe me! but yet to me she wol nat do that grace for which ful pale and welked is my face.  but sirs to yow it is no curteisye to speken to an old man vileinye  but he trespasse in worde or elles in dede. in holy writ ye may yourself wel rede agayns an old man hoor upon his heed ye sholde aryse; wherfor i yeve yow reed ne dooth unto an old man noon harm now  namore than ye wolde men dide to yow in age if that ye so longe abyde; and god be with yow wher ye go or ryde.  i moot go thider as i have to go. nay olde cherl by god thou shall nat so  seyde this other hasardour anon; thou partest nat so lightly by seint iohn! thou spak right now of thilke traitour deeth that in this contree alle our frendes sleeth. have heer my trouthe as thou art his aspye  tel wher he is or thou shalt it abye by god and by the holy sacrament! for soothly thou art oon of his assent  to sleen us yonge folk thou false theef! now sirs quod he if that yow be so leef  to finde deeth turne up this croked wey for in that grove i lafte him by my fey under a tree and ther he wol abyde; nat for your boost he wol him nothing hyde. see ye that ook? right ther ye shul him finde.  god save yow that boghte agayn mankinde and yow amende!thus seyde this olde man. and everich of thise ryotoures ran  til he cam to that tree and ther they founde of florins fyne of golde ycoyned rounde  wel ny an eighte busshels as hem thoughte. no lenger thanne after deeth they soughte but ech of hem so glad was of that sighte for that the florins been so faire and brighte that doun they sette hem by this precious hord.  the worste of hem he spake the firste word. brethren quod he tak kepe what i seye; my wit is greet though that i bourde and pleye.  this tresor hath fortune unto us yiven in mirthe and iolitee our lyf to liven  and lightly as it comth so wol we spende. ey! goddes precious dignitee! who wende today that we sholde han so fair a grace? but mighte this gold be caried fro this place hoom to myn hous or elles unto youres  for wel ye woot that al this gold is oures than were we in heigh felicitee. but trewely by daye it may nat be;  men wolde seyn that we were theves stronge and for our owene tresor doon us honge.  this tresor moste ycaried be by nighte as wysly and as slyly as it mighte. wherfore i rede that cut among us alle be drawe and lat se wher the cut wol falle; and he that hath the cut with herte blythe  shal renne to the toune and that ful swythe and bringe us breed and wyn ful prively. and two of us shul kepen subtilly  this tresor wel; and if he wol nat tarie whan it is night we wol this tresor carie  by oon assent wheras us thinketh best. that oon of hem the cut broughte in his fest and bad hem drawe and loke wher it wol falle; and it fil on the yongeste of hem alle; and forth toward the toun he wente anon.  and also sone as that he was gon that oon of hem spak thus unto that other thou knowest wel thou art my sworne brother  thy profit wol i telle thee anon. thou woost wel that our felawe is agon;  and heer is gold and that ful greet plentee that shal departed been among us three. but natheles if i can shape it so that it departed were among us two hadde i nat doon a freendes torn to thee?  that other answerde i noot how that may be; he woot how that the gold is with us tweye what shal we doon what shal we to him seye?  shal it be conseil? seyde the firste shrewe and i shal tellen thee in wordes fewe  what we shal doon and bringe it wel aboute. i graunte quod that other out of doute that by my trouthe i wol thee nat biwreye. now quod the firste thou woost wel we be tweye and two of us shul strenger be than oon.  look whan that he is set and right anoon arys as though thou woldest with him pleye; and i shal ryve him thurgh the sydes tweye  whyl that thou strogelest with him as in game and with thy dagger look thou do the same;  and than shal al this gold departed be my dere freend bitwixen me and thee; than may we bothe our lustes al fulfille and pleye at dees right at our owene wille. and thus acorded been thise shrewes tweye  to sleen the thridde as ye han herd me seye. this yongest which that wente unto the toun ful ofte in herte he rolleth up and doun  the beautee of thise florins newe and brighte. o lord! quod he if so were that i mighte  have al this tresor to myself allone ther is no man that liveth under the trone of god that sholde live so mery as i! and atte laste the feend our enemy putte in his thought that he shold poyson beye  with which he mighte sleen his felawes tweye; forwhy the feend fond him in swich lyvinge that he had leve him to sorwe bringe  for this was outrely his fulle entente to sleen hem bothe and never to repente.  and forth he gooth no lenger wolde he tarie into the toun unto a pothecarie and preyed him that he him wolde selle som poyson that he mighte his rattes quelle; and eek ther was a polcat in his hawe  that as he seyde his capouns hadde yslawe and fayn he wolde wreke him if he mighte on vermin that destroyed him by nighte.  the pothecarie answerde and thou shalt have a thing that also god my soule save  in al this world ther nis no creature that ete or dronke hath of this confiture noght but the mountance of a corn of whete that he ne shal his lyf anon forlete; ye sterve he shal and that in lasse whyle  than thou wolt goon a paas nat but a myle; this poyson is so strong and violent. this cursed man hath in his hond yhent  this poyson in a box and sith he ran into the nexte strete unto a man  and borwed of him large botels three; and in the two his poyson poured he; the thridde he kepte clene for his drinke. for al the night he shoop him for to swinke in caryinge of the gold out of that place.  and whan this ryotour with sory grace had filled with wyn his grete botels three to his felawes agayn repaireth he.  what nedeth it to sermone of it more? for right as they had cast his deeth bifore  right so they han him slayn and that anon. and whan that this was doon thus spak that oon now lat us sitte and drinke and make us merie and afterward we wol his body berie. and with that word it happed him par cas  to take the botel ther the poyson was and drank and yaf his felawe drinke also for which anon they storven bothe two.  but certes i suppose that avicen wroot never in no canon ne in no fen  mo wonder signes of empoisoning than hadde thise wrecches two er hir ending. thus ended been thise homicydes two and eek the false empoysoner also. o cursed sinne ful of cursednesse!  o traytours homicyde o wikkednesse! o glotonye luxurie and hasardrye! thou blasphemour of crist with vileinye  and othes grete of usage and of pryde! allas! mankinde how may it bityde  that to thy creatour which that thee wroghte and with his precious herteblood thee boghte thou art so fals and so unkinde allas! now goode men god forgeve yow your trespas and ware yow fro the sinne of avaryce.  myn holy pardoun may yow alle waryce so that ye offre nobles or sterlinges or elles silver broches spones ringes.  boweth your heed under this holy bulle! cometh up ye wyves offreth of your wolle!  your name i entre heer in my rolle anon; into the blisse of hevene shul ye gon; i yow assoile by myn heigh power yow that wol offre as clene and eek as cleer as ye were born; and lo sirs thus i preche.  and iesu crist that is our soules leche so graunte yow his pardon to receyve; for that is best; i wol yow nat deceyve.  but sirs o word forgat i in my tale i have relikes and pardon in my male  as faire as any man in engelond whiche were me yeven by the popes hond. if any of yow wol of devocioun offren and han myn absolucioun cometh forth anon and kneleth heer adoun  and mekely receyveth my pardoun: or elles taketh pardon as ye wende al newe and fresh at every tounes ende  so that ye offren alwey newe and newe nobles and pens which that be gode and trewe.  it is an honour to everich that is heer that ye mowe have a suffisant pardoneer tassoille yow in contree as ye ryde for aventures which that may bityde. peraventure ther may falle oon or two  doun of his hors and breke his nekke atwo. look which a seuretee is it to yow alle that i am in your felaweship yfalle  that may assoille yow bothe more and lasse whan that the soule shal fro the body passe  i rede that our hoste heer shal biginne for he is most envoluped in sinne. com forth sir hoste and offre first anon and thou shalt kisse the reliks everichon ye for a grote! unbokel anon thy purs.  nay nay quod he than have i cristes curs! lat be quod he it shal nat be so theech! thou woldest make me kisse thyn old breech  and swere it were a relik of a seint thogh it were with thy fundement depeint!  but by the croys which that seint eleyne fond i wolde i hadde thy coillons in myn hond in stede of relikes or of seintuarie; lat cutte hem of i wol thee helpe hem carie; they shul be shryned in an hogges tord.  this pardoner answerde nat a word; so wrooth he was no word ne wolde he seye. now quod our host i wol no lenger pleye  with thee ne with noon other angry man. but right anon the worthy knight bigan  whan that he saugh that al the peple lough namore of this for it is right ynough; sir pardoner be glad and mery of chere; and ye sir host that been to me so dere i prey yow that ye kisse the pardoner.  and pardoner i prey thee drawe thee neer and as we diden lat us laughe and pleye.  anon they kiste and riden forth hir weye. t. . here is ended the pardoners tale. the prologe of the wyves tale of bathe. experience though noon auctoritee were in this world were right ynough to me to speke of wo that is in mariage; for lordinges sith i twelf yeer was of age thonked be god that is eterne on lyve  housbondes at chirchedore i have had fyve; for i so ofte have ywedded be; and alle were worthy men in hir degree. but me was told certeyn nat longe agon is that sith that crist ne wente never but onis  to wedding in the cane of galilee that by the same ensample taughte he me that i ne sholde wedded be but ones. herke eek lo! which a sharp word for the nones besyde a welle iesus god and man  spak in repreve of the samaritan: thou hast yhad fyve housbondes quod he and thilke man the which that hath now thee is noght thyn housbond; thus seyde he certeyn; what that he mente therby i can nat seyn;  but that i axe why that the fifthe man was noon housbond to the samaritan? how manye mighte she have in mariage? yet herde i never tellen in myn age upon this nombre diffinicioun;  men may devyne and glosen up and doun. but wel i woot expres withoute lye god bad us for to wexe and multiplye; that gentil text can i wel understonde. eek wel i woot he seyde myn housbonde  sholde lete fader and moder and take me; but of no nombre mencioun made he of bigamye or of octogamye; why sholde men speke of it vileinye? lo here the wyse king dan salomon;  i trowe he hadde wyves mo than oon; as wolde god it leveful were to me to be refresshed half so ofte as he! which yifte of god hadde he for alle his wyvis! no man hath swich that in this world alyve is.  god woot this noble king as to my wit the firste night had many a mery fit with ech of hem so wel was him on lyve! blessed be god that i have wedded fyve! welcome the sixte whan that ever he shal.  for sothe i wol nat kepe me chast in al; whan myn housbond is fro the world ygon som cristen man shal wedde me anon; for thanne thapostle seith that i am free to wedde a goddes half wher it lyketh me.  he seith that to be wedded is no sinne; bet is to be wedded than to brinne. what rekketh me thogh folk seye vileinye of shrewed lameth and his bigamye? i woot wel abraham was an holy man  and iacob eek as ferforth as i can; and ech of hem hadde wyves mo than two; and many another holy man also. whan saugh ye ever in any maner age that hye god defended mariage  by expres word? i pray you telleth me; or wher comanded he virginitee? i woot as wel as ye it is no drede thapostel whan he speketh of maydenhede; he seyde that precept therof hadde he noon.  men may conseille a womman to been oon but conseilling is no comandement; he putte it in our owene iugement. for hadde god comanded maydenhede thanne hadde he dampned wedding with the dede;  and certes if ther were no seed ysowe virginitee wherof than sholde it growe? poul dorste nat comanden atte leste a thing of which his maister yaf noon heste. the dart is set up for virginitee;  cacche who so may who renneth best lat see. but this word is nat take of every wight but ther as god list give it of his might. i woot wel that thapostel was a mayde; but natheless thogh that he wroot and sayde  he wolde that every wight were swich as he al nis but conseil to virginitee; and for to been a wyf he yaf me leve of indulgence; so it is no repreve to wedde me if that my make dye  withoute excepcioun of bigamye. al were it good no womman for to touche he mente as in his bed or in his couche; for peril is bothe fyr and tow tassemble; ye knowe what this ensample may resemble.  this is al and som he heeld virginitee more parfit than wedding in freletee. freeltee clepe i butif that he and she wolde leden al hir lyf in chastitee. i graunte it wel i have noon envye  thogh maydenhede preferre bigamye; hem lyketh to be clene body and goost of myn estaat i nil nat make no boost. for wel ye knowe a lord in his houshold he hath nat every vessel al of gold;  somme been of tree and doon hir lord servyse. god clepeth folk to him in sondry wyse and everich hath of god a propre yifte som this som thatas him lyketh shifte. virginitee is greet perfeccioun  and continence eek with devocioun. but crist that of perfeccioun is welle bad nat every wight he shold go selle all that he hadde and give it to the pore and in swich wyse folwe hime and his fore.  he spak to hem that wolde live parfitly; and lordinges by your leve that am nat i. i wol bistowe the flour of al myn age in the actes and in fruit of mariage. telle me also to what conclusioun  were membres maad of generacioun and for what profit was a wight ywroght? trusteth right wel they wer nat maad for noght. glose whoso wole and seye bothe up and doun that they were maked for purgacioun of urine and our bothe thinges smale were eek to knowe a femele from a male and for noone other cause: sey ye no? the experience woot wel it is noght so; so that the clerkes be nat with me wrothe  i sey this that they maked been for bothe this is to seye for office and for ese of engendrure ther we nat god displese. why sholde men elles in hir bokes sette that man shal yelde to his wyf hir dette?  now wherwith sholde he make his payement if he ne used his sely instrument? than were they maad upon a creature to purge uryne and eek for engendrure. but i seye noght that every wight is holde  that hath swich harneys as i to yow tolde to goon and usen hem in engendrure; than sholde men take of chastitee no cure. crist was a mayde and shapen as a man and many a seint sith that the world bigan  yet lived they ever in parfit chastitee. i nil envye no virginitee; lat hem be breed of pured wheteseed and lat us wyves hoten barlybreed; and yet with barlybreed mark telle can  our lord iesu refresshed many a man. in swich estaat as god hath cleped us i wol persevere i nam nat precious. in wyfhode i wol use myn instrument as frely as my maker hath it sent.  if i be daungerous god yeve me sorwe! myn housbond shal it have bothe eve and morwe whan that him list com forth and paye his dette. an housbonde i wol have i nil nat lette which shal be bothe my dettour and my thral  and have his tribulacioun withal upon his flessh whyl that i am his wyf. i have the power duringe al my lyf upon his propre body and noght he. right thus the apostel tolde it unto me;  and bad our housbondes for to love us weel. al this sentence me lyketh everydeel up sterte the pardoner and that anon now dame quod he by god and by seint iohn ye been a noble prechour in this cas!  i was aboute to wedde a wyf; allas! what sholde i bye it on my flesh so dere? yet hadde i lever wedde no wyf toyere! abyde! quod she my tale is nat bigonne; nay thou shalt drinken of another tonne  er that i go shal savoure wors than ale. and whan that i have told thee forth my tale of tribulacioun in mariage of which i am expert in al myn age this to seyn myself have been the whippe;  than maystow chese whether thou wolt sippe of thilke tonne that i shal abroche. be war of it er thou to ny approche; for i shal telle ensamples mo than ten. whoso that nil be war by othere men  by him shul othere men corrected be. the same wordes wryteth ptholomee; rede in his almageste and take it there. dame i wolde praye yow if your wil it were seyde this pardoner as ye bigan  telle forth your tale spareth for no man and teche us yonge men of your praktike. gladly quod she sith it may yow lyke. but yet i praye to al this companye if that i speke after my fantasye  as taketh not agrief of that i seye; for myn entente nis but for to pleye. now sires now wol i telle forth my tale. as ever mote i drinken wyn or ale i shal seye sooth tho housbondes that i hadde  as three of hem were gode and two were badde. the three men were gode and riche and olde; unnethe mighte they the statut holde in which that they were bounden unto me. ye woot wel what i mene of this pardee!  as help me god i laughe whan i thinke how pitously anight i made hem swinke; and by my fey i tolde of it no stoor. they had me yeven hir gold and hir tresoor; me neded nat do lenger diligence  to winne hir love or doon hem reverence. they loved me so wel by god above that i ne tolde no deyntee of hir love! a wys womman wol sette hir ever in oon to gete hir love ther as she hath noon.  but sith i hadde hem hoolly in myn hond and sith they hadde me yeven all hir lond what sholde i taken hede hem for to plese but it were for my profit and myn ese? i sette hem so awerke by my fey  that many a night they songen weilawey! the bacoun was nat fet for hem i trowe that som men han in essex at dunmowe. i governed hem so wel after my lawe that ech of hem ful blisful was and fawe  to bringe me gaye thinges fro the fayre. they were ful glad whan i spak to hem fayre; for god it woot i chidde hem spitously. now herkneth how i bar me proprely ye wyse wyves that can understonde.  thus shul ye speke and bere hem wrong on honde; for half so boldely can ther no man swere and lyen as a womman can. i sey nat this by wyves that ben wyse butif it be whan they hem misavyse.  a wys wyf if that she can hir good shal beren him on hond the cow is wood and take witnesse of hir owene mayde of hir assent; but herkneth how i sayde. sir olde kaynard is this thyn array?  why is my neighebores wyf so gay? she is honoured overal ther she goth; i sitte at hoom i have no thrifty cloth. what dostow at my neighebores hous? is she so fair? artow so amorous?  what rowne ye with our mayde? benedicite! sir olde lechour lat thy iapes be! and if i have a gossib or a freend withouten gilt thou chydest as a feend if that i walke or pleye unto his hous!  thou comest hoom as dronken as a mous and prechest on thy bench with yvel preef! thou seist to me it is a greet meschief to wedde a povre womman for costage; and if that she be riche of heigh parage  than seistow that it is a tormentrye to suffre hir pryde and hir malencolye. and if that she be fair thou verray knave thou seyst that every holour wol hir have; she may no whyle in chastitee abyde  that is assailled upon ech a syde. thou seyst som folk desyre us for richesse somme for our shap and somme for our fairnesse; and som for she can outher singe or daunce and som for gentillesse and daliaunce;  som for hir handes and hir armes smale; thus goth al to the devel by thy tale. thou seyst men may nat kepe a castelwal; it may so longe assailled been overal. and if that she be foul thou seist that she  coveiteth every man that she may se; for as a spaynel she wol on him lepe til that she finde som man hir to chepe; ne noon so grey goos goth ther in the lake as seistow that wol been withoute make.  and seyst it is an hard thing for to welde a thing that no man wol his thankes helde. thus seistow lorel whan thow goost to bedde; and that no wys man nedeth for to wedde ne no man that entendeth unto hevene.  with wilde thonderdint and firy levene mote thy welked nekke be tobroke! thow seyst that dropping houses and eek smoke and chyding wyves maken men to flee out of hir owene hous; a! benedicite!  what eyleth swich an old man for to chyde? thow seyst we wyves wol our vyces hyde til we be fast and than we wol hem shewe; wel may that be a proverbe of a shrewe! thou seist that oxen asses hors and houndes  they been assayed at diverse stoundes; bacins lavours er that men hem bye spones and stoles and al swich housbondrye and so been pottes clothes and array; but folk of wyves maken noon assay  til they be wedded; olde dotard shrewe! and than seistow we wol oure vices shewe. thou seist also that it displeseth me butif that thou wolt preyse my beautee and but thou poure alwey upon my face  and clepe me faire dame in every place; and but thou make a feste on thilke day that i was born and make me fresh and gay and but thou do to my norice honour and to my chamberere withinne my bour  and to my fadres folk and his allyes; thus seistow olde barel ful of lyes! and yet of our apprentice ianekyn for his crisp heer shyninge as gold so fyn and for he squiereth me bothe up and doun  yet hastow caught a fals suspecioun; i wol hym noght thogh thou were deed tomorwe. but tel me this why hydestow with sorwe the keyes of thy cheste awey fro me? it is my good as wel as thyn pardee.  what wenestow make an idiot of our dame? now by that lord that called is seint iame thou shalt nat bothe thogh that thou were wood be maister of my body and of my good; that oon thou shalt forgo maugree thyne yen;  what nedeth thee of me to enquere or spyen? i trowe thou woldest loke me in thy chiste! thou sholdest seye wyf go wher thee liste tak your disport i wol nat leve no talis; i knowe yow for a trewe wyf dame alis.  we love no man that taketh kepe or charge wher that we goon we wol ben at our large. of alle men yblessed moot he be the wyse astrologien dan ptholome that seith this proverbe in his almageste  of alle men his wisdom is the hyeste that rekketh never who hath the world in honde. by this proverbe thou shalt understonde have thou ynogh what thar thee recche or care how merily that othere folkes fare?  for certeyn olde dotard by your leve ye shul have queynte right ynough at eve. he is to greet a nigard that wol werne a man to lighte his candle at his lanterne; he shal have never the lasse light pardee;  have thou ynough thee thar nat pleyne thee. thou seyst also that if we make us gay with clothing and with precious array that it is peril of our chastitee; and yet with sorwe thou most enforce thee  and seye thise wordes in the apostles name in habit maad with chastitee and shame ye wommen shul apparaille yow quod he and noght in tressed heer and gay perree as perles ne with gold ne clothes riche;  after thy text ne after thy rubriche i wol nat wirche as muchel as a gnat. thou seydest this that i was lyk a cat; for whoso wolde senge a cattes skin thanne wolde the cat wel dwellen in his in;  and if the cattes skin be slyk and gay she wol nat dwelle in house half a day but forth she wole er any day be dawed to shewe hir skin and goon acaterwawed; this is to seye if i be gay sir shrewe  i wol renne out my borel for to shewe. sire olde fool what eyleth thee to spyen? thogh thou preye argus with his hundred yen to be my wardecors as he can best in feith he shal nat kepe me but me lest;  yet coude i make his berd so moot i thee. thou seydest eek that ther ben thinges three the whiche thinges troublen al this erthe and that no wight ne may endure the ferthe; o leve sir shrewe iesu shorte thy lyf!  yet prechestow and seyst an hateful wyf yrekened is for oon of thise meschances. been ther none othere maner resemblances that ye may lykne your parables to butif a sely wyf be oon of tho?  thou lykenest wommanes love to helle to bareyne lond ther water may not dwelle. thou lyknest it also to wilde fyr; the more it brenneth the more it hath desyr to consume every thing that brent wol be.  thou seyst that right as wormes shende a tree right so a wyf destroyeth hir housbonde; this knowe they that been to wyves bonde. lordinges right thus as ye have understonde bar i stifly myne olde housbondes on honde  that thus they seyden in hir dronkenesse; and al was fals but that i took witnesse on ianekin and on my nece also. o lord the peyne i dide hem and the wo ful giltelees by goddes swete pyne!  for as an hors i coude byte and whyne. i coude pleyne thogh i were in the gilt or elles often tyme hadde i ben spilt. whoso that first to mille comth first grint; i pleyned first so was our werre ystint.  they were ful glad to excusen hem ful blyve of thing of which they never agilte hir lyve. of wenches wolde i beren him on honde whan that for syk unnethes mighte he stonde. yet tikled it his herte for that he  wende that i hadde of him so greet chiertee. i swoor that al my walkinge out by nighte was for tespye wenches that he dighte; under that colour hadde i many a mirthe. for al swich wit is yeven us in our birthe;  deceite weping spinning god hath yive to wommen kindely whyl they may live. and thus of o thing i avaunte me atte ende i hadde the bettre in ech degree by sleighte or force or by som maner thing  as by continuel murmur or grucching; namely a bedde hadden they meschaunce ther wolde i chyde and do hem no plesaunce; i wolde no lenger in the bed abyde if that i felte his arm over my syde  til he had maad his raunson unto me; than wolde i suffre him do his nycetee. and therfore every man this tale i telle winne whoso may for al is for to selle. with empty hand men may none haukes lure;  for winning wolde i al his lust endure and make me a feyned appetyt; and yet in bacon hadde i never delyt; that made me that ever i wolde hem chyde. for thogh the pope had seten hem biside  i wolde nat spare hem at hir owene bord. for by my trouthe i quitte hem word for word. as help me verray god omnipotent thogh i right now sholde make my testament i ne owe hem nat a word that it nis quit.  i broghte it so aboute by my wit that they moste yeve it up as for the beste; or elles hadde we never been in reste. for thogh he loked as a wood leoun yet sholde he faille of his conclusioun.  thanne wolde i seye gode lief tak keep how mekely loketh wilkin oure sheep; com neer my spouse lat me ba thy cheke! ye sholde been al pacient and meke and han a swete spyced conscience  sith ye so preche of iobes pacience. suffreth alwey sin ye so wel can preche; and but ye do certain we shal yow teche that it is fair to have a wyf in pees. oon of us two moste bowen doutelees;  and sith a man is more resonable than womman is ye moste been suffrable. what eyleth yow to grucche thus and grone? is it for ye wolde have my queynte allone? why taak it al lo have it everydeel;  peter! i shrewe yow but ye love it weel! for if i wolde selle my bele chose i coude walke as fresh as is a rose; but i wol kepe it for your owene tooth. ye be to blame by god i sey yow sooth.  swiche maner wordes hadde we on honde. now wol i speken of my fourthe housbonde. my fourthe housbonde was a revelour this is to seyn he hadde a paramour; and i was yong and ful of ragerye  stiborn and strong and ioly as a pye. wel coude i daunce to an harpe smale and singe ywis as any nightingale whan i had dronke a draughte of swete wyn. metellius the foule cherl the swyn  that with a staf birafte his wyf hir lyf for she drank wyn thogh i hadde been his wyf he sholde nat han daunted me fro drinke; and after wyn on venus moste i thinke: for al so siker as cold engendreth hayl  a likerous mouth moste han a likerous tayl. in womman vinolent is no defence this knowen lechours by experience. but lord crist! whan that it remembreth me upon my yowthe and on my iolitee  it tikleth me aboute myn herte rote. unto this day it dooth myn herte bote that i have had my world as in my tyme. but age allas! that al wol envenyme hath me biraft my beautee and my pith;  lat go farewel the devel go therwith! the flour is goon ther is namore to telle the bren as i best can now moste i selle; but yet to be right mery wol i fonde. now wol i tellen of my fourthe housbonde.  i seye i hadde in herte greet despyt that he of any other had delyt. but he was quit by god and by seint ioce! i made him of the same wode a croce; nat of my body in no foul manere  but certeinly i made folk swich chere that in his owene grece i made him frye for angre and for verray ialousye. by god in erthe i was his purgatorie for which i hope his soule be in glorie.  for god it woot he sat ful ofte and song whan that his shoo ful bitterly him wrong. ther was no wight save god and he that wiste in many wyse how sore i him twiste. he deyde whan i cam fro ierusalem  and lyth ygrave under the rodebeem al is his tombe noght so curious as was the sepulcre of him darius which that appelles wroghte subtilly; it nis but wast to burie him preciously.  lat him farewel god yeve his soule reste he is now in the grave and in his cheste. now of my fifthe housbond wol i telle. god lete his soule never come in helle! and yet was he to me the moste shrewe;  that fele i on my ribbes al by rewe and ever shal unto myn endingday. but in our bed he was so fresh and gay and therwithal so wel coude he me glose whan that he wolde han my bele chose  that thogh he hadde me bet on every boon he coude winne agayn my love anoon. i trowe i loved him beste for that he was of his love daungerous to me. we wommen han if that i shal nat lye  in this matere a queynte fantasye; wayte what thing we may nat lightly have therafter wol we crye alday and crave. forbede us thing and that desyren we; prees on us faste and thanne wol we flee.  with daunger oute we al our chaffare; greet prees at market maketh dere ware and to greet cheep is holde at litel prys; this knoweth every womman that is wys. my fifthe housbonde god his soule blesse!  which that i took for love and no richesse he somtyme was a clerk of oxenford and had left scole and wente at hoom to bord with my gossib dwellinge in oure toun god have hir soule! hir name was alisoun.  she knew myn herte and eek my privetee bet than our parisshepreest so moot i thee! to hir biwreyed i my conseil al. for had myn housbonde pissed on a wal or doon a thing that sholde han cost his lyf  to hir and to another worthy wyf and to my nece which that i loved weel i wolde han told his conseil everydeel. and so i dide ful often god it woot that made his face ful often reed and hoot  for verray shame and blamed himself for he had told to me so greet a privetee. and so bifel that ones in a lente so often tymes i to my gossib wente for ever yet i lovede to be gay  and for to walke in march averille and may fro hous to hous to here sondry talis that iankin clerk and my gossib dame alis and i myself into the feldes wente. myn housbond was at london al that lente;  i hadde the bettre leyser for to pleye and for to see and eek for to be seye of lusty folk; what wiste i wher my grace was shapen for to be or in what place? therefore i made my visitaciouns  to vigilies and to processiouns to preching eek and to thise pilgrimages to pleyes of miracles and mariages and wered upon my gaye scarlet gytes. thise wormes ne thise motthes ne thise mytes  upon my peril frete hem never a deel; and wostow why? for they were used weel. now wol i tellen forth what happed me. i seye that in the feeldes walked we til trewely we hadde swich daliance  this clerk and i that of my purveyance i spak to him and seyde him how that he if i were widwe sholde wedde me. for certeinly i sey for no bobance yet was i never withouten purveyance  of mariage nof othere thinges eek. i holde a mouses herte nat worth a leek that hath but oon hole for to sterte to and if that faille thanne is al ydo. i bar him on honde he hadde enchanted me;  my dame taughte me that soutiltee. and eek i seyde i mette of him al night; he wolde han slayn me as i lay upright and al my bed was ful of verray blood but yet i hope that he shal do me good;  for blood bitokeneth gold as me was taught. and al was fals i dremed of it right naught but as i folwed ay my dames lore as wel of this as of other thinges more. but now sir lat me see what i shal seyn?  a! ha! by god i have my tale ageyn. whan that my fourthe housbond was on bere i weep algate and made sory chere as wyves moten for it is usage and with my coverchief covered my visage;  but for that i was purveyed of a make i weep but smal and that i undertake. to chirche was myn housbond born amorwe with neighebores that for him maden sorwe; and iankin oure clerk was oon of tho.  as help me god whan that i saugh him go after the bere me thoughte he hadde a paire of legges and of feet so clene and faire that al myn herte i yaf unto his hold. he was i trowe a twenty winter old  and i was fourty if i shal seye sooth; but yet i hadde alwey a coltes tooth. gattothed i was and that bicam me weel; i hadde the prente of seynt venus seel. as help me god i was a lusty oon  and faire and riche and yong and wel bigoon; and trewely as myne housbondes tolde me i had the beste quoniam mighte be. for certes i am al venerien in felinge and myn herte is marcien.  venus me yaf my lust my likerousnesse and mars yaf me my sturdy hardinesse. myn ascendent was taur and mars therinne. allas! allas! that ever love was sinne! i folwed ay myn inclinacioun  by vertu of my constellacioun; that made me i coude noght withdrawe my chambre of venus from a good felawe. yet have i martes mark upon my face and also in another privee place.  for god so wis be my savacioun i ne loved never by no discrecioun but ever folwede myn appetyt al were he short or long or blak or whyt; i took no kepe so that he lyked me  how pore he was ne eek of what degree. what sholde i seye but at the monthes ende this ioly clerk iankin that was so hende hath wedded me with greet solempnitee and to him yaf i al the lond and fee  that ever was me yeven therbifore; but afterward repented me ful sore. he nolde suffre nothing of my list. by god he smoot me ones on the list for that i rente out of his book a leef  that of the strook myn ere wex al deef. stiborn i was as is a leonesse and of my tonge a verray iangleresse and walke i wolde as i had doon biforn from hous to hous although he had it sworn.  for which he often tymes wolde preche and me of olde romayn gestes teche how he simplicius gallus lefte his wyf and hir forsook for terme of al his lyf noght but for openheeded he hir say  lokinge out at his dore upon a day. another romayn tolde he me by name that for his wyf was at a someres game withoute his witing he forsook hir eke. and than wolde he upon his bible seke  that ilke proverbe of ecclesiaste wher he comandeth and forbedeth faste man shal nat suffre his wyf go roule aboute; than wolde he seye right thus withouten doute whoso that buildeth his hous al of salwes  and priketh his blinde hors over the falwes and suffreth his wyf to go seken halwes is worthy to been hanged on the galwes! but al for noght i sette noght an hawe of his proverbes nof his olde sawe  ne i wolde nat of him corrected be. i hate him that my vices telleth me and so do mo god woot! of us than i. this made him with me wood al outrely; i nolde noght forbere him in no cas.  now wol i seye yow sooth by seint thomas why that i rente out of his book a leef for which he smoot me so that i was deef. he hadde a book that gladly night and day for his desport he wolde rede alway.  he cleped it valerie and theofraste at whiche book he lough alwey ful faste. and eek ther was somtyme a clerk at rome a cardinal that highte seint ierome that made a book agayn iovinian;  in whiche book eek ther was tertulan crisippus trotula and helowys that was abbesse nat fer fro parys; and eek the parables of salomon ovydes art and bokes many on  and alle thise wer bounden in o volume. and every night and day was his custume whan he had leyser and vacacioun from other worldly occupacioun to reden on this book of wikked wyves.  he knew of hem mo legendes and lyves than been of gode wyves in the bible. for trusteth wel it is an impossible that any clerk wol speke good of wyves butif it be of holy seintes lyves  ne of noon other womman never the mo. who peyntede the leoun tel me who? by god if wommen hadde writen stories as clerkes han withinne hir oratories they wolde han writen of men more wikkednesse  than all the mark of adam may redresse. the children of mercurie and of venus been in hir wirking ful contrarious; mercurie loveth wisdom and science and venus loveth ryot and dispence.  and for hir diverse disposicioun ech falleth in otheres exaltacioun; and thus god woot! mercurie is desolat in pisces wher venus is exaltat; and venus falleth ther mercurie is reysed;  therfore no womman of no clerk is preysed. the clerk whan he is old and may noght do of venus werkes worth his olde sho than sit he doun and writ in his dotage that wommen can nat kepe hir mariage!  but now to purpos why i tolde thee that i was beten for a book pardee. upon a night iankin that was our syre redde on his book as he sat by the fyre of eva first that for hir wikkednesse  was al mankinde broght to wrecchednesse for which that iesu crist himself was slayn that boghte us with his herteblood agayn. lo here expres of womman may ye finde that womman was the los of al mankinde.  tho redde he me how sampson loste his heres slepinge his lemman kitte hem with hir sheres; thurgh whiche tresoun loste he bothe his yen. tho redde he me if that i shal nat lyen of hercules and of his dianyre  that caused him to sette himself afyre. nothing forgat he the penaunce and wo that socrates had with hise wyves two; how xantippa caste pisse upon his heed; this sely man sat stille as he were deed;  he wyped his heed namore dorste he seyn but er that thonder stinte comth a reyn. of phasipha that was the quene of crete for shrewednesse him thoughte the tale swete; fy! spek namoreit is a grisly thing  of hir horrible lust and hir lyking. of clitemistra for hir lecherye that falsly made hir housbond for to dye he redde it with ful good devocioun. he tolde me eek for what occasioun  amphiorax at thebes loste his lyf; myn housbond hadde a legende of his wyf eriphilem that for an ouche of gold hath prively unto the grekes told wher that hir housbonde hidde him in a place  for which he hadde at thebes sory grace. of lyma tolde he me and of lucye they bothe made hir housbondes for to dye; that oon for love that other was for hate; lyma hir housbond on an even late  empoysoned hath for that she was his fo. lucya likerous loved hir housbond so that for he sholde alwey upon hir thinke she yaf him swich a maner lovedrinke that he was deed er it were by the morwe;  and thus algates housbondes han sorwe. than tolde he me how oon latumius compleyned to his felawe arrius that in his gardin growed swich a tree on which he seyde how that his wyves three  hanged hemself for herte despitous. o leve brother quod this arrius yif me a plante of thilke blissed tree and in my gardin planted shal it be! of latter date of wyves hath he red  that somme han slayn hir housbondes in hir bed and lete hir lechour dighte hir al the night whyl that the corps lay in the floor upright. and somme han drive nayles in hir brayn whyl that they slepte and thus they han hem slayn.  somme han hem yeve poysoun in hir drinke. he spak more harm than herte may bithinke. and therwithal he knew of mo proverbes than in this world ther growen gras or herbes. bet is quod he thyn habitacioun  be with a leoun or a foul dragoun than with a womman usinge for to chyde. bet is quod he hye in the roof abyde than with an angry wyf doun in the hous; they been so wikked and contrarious;  they haten that hir housbondes loveth ay. he seyde a womman cast hir shame away whan she cast of hir smok; and forthermo a fair womman but she be chaast also is lyk a gold ring in a sowes nose.  who wolde wenen or who wolde suppose the wo that in myn herte was and pyne? and whan i saugh he wolde never fyne to reden on this cursed book al night al sodeynly three leves have i plight  out of his book right as he radde and eke i with my fist so took him on the cheke that in our fyr he fil bakward adoun. and he upstirte as dooth a wood leoun and with his fist he smoot me on the heed  that in the floor i lay as i were deed. and when he saugh how stille that i lay he was agast and wolde han fled his way til atte laste out of my swogh i breyde: o! hastow slayn me false theef? i seyde  and for my land thus hastow mordred me? er i be deed yet wol i kisse thee. and neer he cam and kneled faire adoun and seyde dere suster alisoun as help me god i shal thee never smyte;  that i have doon it is thyself to wyte. foryeve it me and that i thee biseke and yet eftsones i hitte him on the cheke and seyde theef thus muchel am i wreke; now wol i dye i may no lenger speke.  but atte laste with muchel care and wo we fille acorded by us selven two. he yaf me al the brydel in myn hond to han the governance of hous and lond and of his tonge and of his hond also  and made him brenne his book anon right tho. and whan that i hadde geten unto me by maistrie al the soveraynetee and that he seyde myn owene trewe wyf do as thee lust the terme of al thy lyf  keep thyn honour and keep eek myn estaat after that day we hadden never debaat. god help me so i was to him as kinde as any wyf from denmark unto inde and also trewe and so was he to me.  i prey to god that sit in magestee so blesse his soule for his mercy dere! now wol i seye my tale if ye wol here. biholde the wordes bitween the somonour and the frere. the frere lough whan he hadde herd al this now dame quod he so have i ioye or blis  this is a long preamble of a tale! and whan the somnour herde the frere gale lo! quod the somnour goddes armes two! a frere wol entremette him evermo. lo gode men a flye and eek a frere  wol falle in every dish and eek matere. what spekestow of preambulacioun? what! amble or trotte or pees or go sit doun; thou lettest our disport in this manere. ye woltow so sir somnour? quod the frere  now by my feith i shal er that i go telle of a somnour swich a tale or two that alle the folk shal laughen in this place. now elles frere i bishrewe thy face quod this somnour and i bishrewe me  butif i telle tales two or thre of freres er i come to sidingborne that i shal make thyn herte for to morne; for wel i wool thy patience is goon. our hoste cryde pees! and that anoon!  and seyde lat the womman telle hir tale. ye fare as folk that dronken been of ale. do dame tel forth your tale and that is best. al redy sir quod she right as yow lest if i have licence of this worthy frere.  yis dame quod he tel forth and i wol here. here endeth the wyf of bathe hir prologe. here biginneth the tale of the wyf of bathe. in tholde dayes of the king arthour of which that britons speken greet honour al was this land fulfild of fayerye. the elfqueen with hir ioly companye  daunced ful ofte in many a grene mede; this was the olde opinion as i rede i speke of manye hundred yeres ago; but now can no man see none elves mo. for now the grete charitee and prayeres  of limitours and othere holy freres  that serchen every lond and every streem as thikke as motes in the sonnebeem blessinge halles chambres kichenes boures citees burghes castels hye toures  thropes bernes shipnes dayeryes this maketh that ther been no fayeryes. for ther as wont to walken was an elf ther walketh now the limitour himself in undermeles and in morweninges  and seyth his matins and his holy thinges  as he goth in his limitacioun. wommen may go saufly up and doun in every bush or under every tree; ther is noon other incubus but he  and he ne wol doon hem but dishonour. and so bifel it that this king arthour hadde in his hous a lusty bacheler that on a day cam rydinge fro river; and happed that allone as she was born  he saugh a mayde walkinge him biforn  of whiche mayde anon maugree hir heed by verray force he rafte hir maydenheed; for which oppressioun was swich clamour and swich pursute unto the king arthour  that dampned was this knight for to be deed by cours of lawe and sholde han lost his heed paraventure swich was the statut tho; but that the quene and othere ladies mo so longe preyeden the king of grace  til he his lyf him graunted in the place  and yaf him to the quene al at hir wille to chese whether she wolde him save or spille. the quene thanketh the king with al hir might and after this thus spak she to the knight  whan that she saugh hir tyme upon a day: thou standest yet quod she in swich array that of thy lyf yet hastow no suretee. i grante thee lyf if thou canst tellen me what thing is it that wommen most desyren?  be war and keep thy nekkeboon from yren.  and if thou canst nat tellen it anon yet wol i yeve thee leve for to gon a twelfmonth and a day to seche and lere an answere suffisant in this matere.  and suretee wol i han er that thou pace thy body for to yelden in this place. wo was this knight and sorwefully he syketh; but what! he may nat do al as him lyketh. and at the laste he chees him for to wende  and come agayn right at the yeres ende  with swich answere as god wolde him purveye; and taketh his leve and wendeth forth his weye. he seketh every hous and every place wheras he hopeth for to finde grace  to lerne what thing wommen loven most; but he ne coude arryven in no cost wheras he mighte finde in this matere two creatures accordinge infere. somme seyde wommen loven best richesse  somme seyde honour somme seyde iolynesse;  somme riche array somme seyden lust abedde and ofte tyme to be widwe and wedde. somme seyde that our hertes been most esed whan that we been yflatered and yplesed.  he gooth ful ny the sothe i wol nat lye; a man shal winne us best with flaterye; and with attendance and with bisinesse been we ylymed bothe more and lesse. and somme seyn how that we loven best  for to be free and do right as us lest  and that no man repreve us of our vyce but seye that we be wyse and nothing nyce. for trewely ther is noon of us alle if any wight wol clawe us on the galle  that we nil kike for he seith us sooth; assay and he shal finde it that so dooth. for be we never so vicious withinne we wol been holden wyse and clene of sinne. and somme seyn that greet delyt han we  for to ben holden stable and eek secree  and in o purpos stedefastly to dwelle and nat biwreye thing that men us telle. but that tale is nat worth a rakestele; pardee we wommen conne nothing hele;  witnesse on myda; wol ye here the tale? ovyde amonges othere thinges smale seyde myda hadde under his longe heres growinge upon his heed two asses eres the which vyce he hidde as he best mighte  ful subtilly from every mannes sighte  that save his wyf ther wiste of it namo. he loved hir most and trusted hir also; he preyede hir that to no creature she sholde tellen of his disfigure.  she swoor him nay for al this world to winne she nolde do that vileinye or sinne to make hir housbond han so foul a name; she nolde nat telle it for hir owene shame. but nathelees hir thoughte that she dyde  that she so longe sholde a conseil hyde;  hir thoughte it swal so sore aboute hir herte that nedely som word hir moste asterte; and sith she dorste telle it to no man doun to a mareys faste by she ran;  til she came there hir herte was afyre and as a bitore bombleth in the myre she leyde hir mouth unto the water doun: biwreye me nat thou water with thy soun quod she to thee i telle it and namo;  myn housbond hath longe asses eres two!  now is myn herte all hool now is it oute; i mighte no lenger kepe it out of doute heer may ye se thogh we a tyme abyde yet out it moot we can no conseil hyde;  the remenant of the tale if ye wol here redeth ovyde and ther ye may it lere. this knight of which my tale is specially whan that he saugh he mighte nat come therby this is to seye what wommen loven moost  withinne his brest ful sorweful was the goost;  but hoom he gooth he mighte nat soiourne. the day was come that hoomward moste he tourne and in his wey it happed him to ryde in al this care under a forestsyde  wheras he saugh upon a daunce go of ladies foure and twenty and yet mo; toward the whiche daunce he drow ful yerne in hope that som wisdom sholde he lerne. but certeinly er he came fully there  vanisshed was this daunce he niste where.  no creature saugh he that bar lyf save on the grene he saugh sittinge a wyf; a fouler wight ther may no man devyse. agayn the knight this olde wyf gan ryse  and seyde sir knight heerforth ne lyth no wey. tel me what that ye seken by your fey? paraventure it may the bettre be; thise olde folk can muchel thing quod she. my leve mooder quod this knight certeyn  i nam but deed butif that i can seyn  what thing it is that wommen most desyre; coude ye me wisse i wolde wel quyte your hyre. plighte me thy trouthe heer in myn hand quod she the nexte thing that i requere thee  thou shalt it do if it lye in thy might; and i wol telle it yow er it be night. have heer my trouthe quod the knight i grante. thanne quod she i dar me wel avante thy lyf is sauf for i wol stonde therby  upon my lyf the queen wol seye as i.  lat see which is the proudeste of hem alle that wereth on a coverchief or a calle that dar seye nay of that i shal thee teche; lat us go forth withouten lenger speche.  tho rouned she a pistel in his ere and bad him to be glad and have no fere. whan they be comen to the court this knight seyde he had holde his day as he hadde hight and redy was his answere as he sayde.  ful many a noble wyf and many a mayde  and many a widwe for that they ben wyse the quene hirself sittinge as a iustyse assembled been his answere for to here; and afterward this knight was bode appere.  to every wight comanded was silence and that the knight sholde telle in audience what thing that worldly wommen loven best. this knight ne stood nat stille as doth a best but to his questioun anon answerde  with manly voys that al the court it herde:  my lige lady generally quod he wommen desyren to have sovereyntee as wel over hir housbond as hir love and for to been in maistrie him above;  this is your moste desyr thogh ye me kille doth as yow list i am heer at your wille. in al the court ne was ther wyf ne mayde ne widwe that contraried that he sayde but seyden he was worthy han his lyf.  and with that word up stirte the olde wyf  which that the knight saugh sittinge in the grene: mercy quod she my sovereyn lady quene! er that your court departe do me right. i taughte this answere unto the knight;  for which he plighte me his trouthe there the firste thing i wolde of him requere he wolde it do if it lay in his might. bifore the court than preye i thee sir knight quod she that thou me take unto thy wyf;  for wel thou wost that i have kept thy lyf.  if i sey fals sey nay upon thy fey! this knight answerde allas! and weylawey! i woot right wel that swich was my biheste. for goddes love as chees a newe requeste;  tak al my good and lat my body go. nay than quod she i shrewe us bothe two! for thogh that i be foul and old and pore i nolde for al the metal ne for ore that under erthe is grave or lyth above  butif thy wyf i were and eek thy love.  my love? quod he; nay my dampnacioun! allas! that any of my nacioun sholde ever so foule disparaged be! but al for noght the ende is this that he  constreyned was he nedes moste hir wedde; and taketh his olde wyf and gooth to bedde. now wolden som men seye paraventure that for my necligence i do no cure to tellen yow the ioye and al tharray  that at the feste was that ilke day.  to whiche thing shortly answere i shal; i seye ther nas no ioye ne feste at al ther nas but hevinesse and muche sorwe; for prively he wedded hir on a morwe  and al day after hidde him as an oule; so wo was him his wyf looked so foule. greet was the wo the knight hadde in his thoght whan he was with his wyf abedde ybroght; he walweth and he turneth to and fro.  his olde wyf lay smylinge evermo  and seyde o dere housbond benedicite! fareth every knight thus with his wyf as ye? is this the lawe of king arthures hous? is every knight of his so dangerous?  i am your owene love and eek your wyf; i am she which that saved hath your lyf; and certes yet dide i yow never unright; why fare ye thus with me this firste night? ye faren lyk a man had lost his wit;  what is my gilt? for goddes love tel me it  and it shal been amended if i may. amended? quod this knight allas! nay nay! it wol nat been amended never mo! thou art so loothly and so old also  and therto comen of so lowe a kinde that litel wonder is thogh i walwe and winde. so wolde god myn herte wolde breste! is this quod she the cause of your unreste? ye certainly quod he no wonder is.  now sire quod she i coude amende al this  if that me liste er it were dayes three so wel ye mighte here yow unto me. but for ye speken of swich gentillesse as is descended out of old richesse  that therfore sholden ye be gentil men swich arrogance is nat worth an hen. loke who that is most vertuous alway privee and apert and most entendeth ay to do the gentil dedes that he can  and tak him for the grettest gentil man.  crist wol we clayme of him our gentillesse nat of our eldres for hir old richesse. for thogh they yeve us al hir heritage for which we clayme to been of heigh parage  yet may they nat biquethe for nothing to noon of us hir vertuous living that made hem gentil men ycalled be; and bad us folwen hem in swich degree. wel can the wyse poete of florence  that highte dant speken in this sentence;  lo in swich maner rym is dantes tale: ful selde up ryseth by his branches smale prowesse of man for god of his goodnesse wol that of him we clayme our gentillesse;  for of our eldres may we nothing clayme but temporel thing that man may hurte and mayme. eek every wight wot this as wel as i if gentillesse were planted naturelly unto a certeyn linage doun the lyne  privee ne apert than wolde they never fyne  to doon of gentillesse the faire offyce; they mighte do no vileinye or vyce. tak fyr and ber it in the derkeste hous bitwix this and the mount of caucasus  and lat men shette the dores and go thenne; yet wol the fyr as faire lye and brenne as twenty thousand men mighte it biholde; his office naturel ay wol it holde up peril of my lyf til that it dye.  heer may ye see wel how that genterye  is nat annexed to possessioun sith folk ne doon hir operacioun alwey as dooth the fyr lo! in his kinde. for god it woot men may wel often finde  a lordes sone do shame and vileinye; and he that wol han prys of his gentrye for he was boren of a gentil hous and hadde hise eldres noble and vertuous and nil himselven do no gentil dedis  ne folwe his gentil auncestre that deed is  he nis nat gentil be he duk or erl; for vileyns sinful dedes make a cherl. for gentillesse nis but renomee of thyne auncestres for hir heigh bountee  which is a strange thing to thy persone. thy gentillesse cometh fro god allone; than comth our verray gentillesse of grace it was nothing biquethe us with our place. thenketh how noble as seith valerius  was thilke tullius hostilius  that out of povert roos to heigh noblesse. redeth senek and redeth eek boece ther shul ye seen expres that it no drede is that he is gentil that doth gentil dedis;  and therfore leve housbond i thus conclude al were it that myne auncestres were rude yet may the hye god and so hope i grante me grace to liven vertuously. thanne am i gentil whan that i biginne  to liven vertuously and weyve sinne.  and theras ye of povert me repreve the hye god on whom that we bileve in wilful povert chees to live his lyf. and certes every man mayden or wyf  may understonde that iesus hevene king ne wolde nat chese a vicious living. glad povert is an honest thing certeyn; this wol senek and othere clerkes seyn. whoso that halt him payd of his poverte  i holde him riche al hadde he nat a sherte.  he that coveyteth is a povre wight for he wolde han that is nat in his might. but he that noght hath ne coveyteth have is riche although ye holde him but a knave.  verray povert it singeth proprely; iuvenal seith of povert merily: the povre man whan he goth by the weye bifore the theves he may singe and pleye. povert is hateful good and as i gesse  a ful greet bringer out of bisinesse;  a greet amender eek of sapience to him that taketh it in pacience. povert is this although it seme elenge: possessioun that no wight wol chalenge.  povert ful ofte whan a man is lowe maketh his god and eek himself to knowe. povert a spectacle is as thinketh me thurgh which he may his verray frendes see. and therfore sire sin that i noght yow greve  of my povert namore ye me repreve.  now sire of elde ye repreve me; and certes sire thogh noon auctoritee were in no book ye gentils of honour seyn that men sholde an old wight doon favour  and clepe him fader for your gentillesse; and auctours shal i finden as i gesse. now ther ye seye that i am foul and old than drede you noght to been a cokewold; for filthe and elde also moot i thee  been grete wardeyns upon chastitee.  but nathelees sin i knowe your delyt i shal fulfille your worldly appetyt. chees now quod she oon of thise thinges tweye to han me foul and old til that i deye  and be to yow a trewe humble wyf and never yow displese in al my lyf or elles ye wol han me yong and fair and take your aventure of the repair that shal be to your hous bycause of me  or in som other place may wel be.  now chees yourselven whether that yow lyketh. this knight avyseth him and sore syketh but atte laste he seyde in this manere my lady and my love and wyf so dere  i put me in your wyse governance; cheseth yourself which may be most plesance and most honour to yow and me also. i do no fors the whether of the two; for as yow lyketh it suffiseth me.  thanne have i gete of yow maistrye quod she  sin i may chese and governe as me lest? ye certes wyf quod he i holde it best. kis me quod she we be no lenger wrothe; for by my trouthe i wol be to yow bothe  this is to seyn ye bothe fair and good. i prey to god that i mot sterven wood but i to yow be also good and trewe as ever was wyf sin that the world was newe. and but i be tomorn as fair to sene  as any lady emperyce or quene  that is bitwixe the est and eke the west doth with my lyf and deeth right as yow lest. cast up the curtin loke how that it is. and whan the knight saugh verraily al this  that she so fair was and so yong therto for ioye he hente hir in his armes two his herte bathed in a bath of blisse; a thousand tyme arewe he gan hir kisse. and she obeyed him in every thing  that mighte doon him plesance or lyking.  and thus they live unto hir lyves ende in parfit ioye; and iesu crist us sende housbondes meke yonge and fresshe abedde and grace toverbyde hem that we wedde.  and eek i preye iesu shorte hir lyves that wol nat be governed by hir wyves; and olde and angry nigardes of dispence god sende hem sone verray pestilence. here endeth the wyves tale of bathe. the prologe of the freres tale. this worthy limitour this noble frere  he made alwey a maner louring chere upon the somnour but for honestee no vileyns word as yet to him spak he. but atte laste he seyde unto the wyf dame quod he god yeve yow right good lyf!  ye han heer touched also moot i thee in scolematere greet difficultee; ye han seyd muchel thing right wel i seye; but dame here as we ryden by the weye  us nedeth nat to speken but of game  and lete auctoritees on goddes name to preching and to scole eek of clergye. but if it lyke to this companye i wol yow of a somnour telle a game. pardee ye may wel knowe by the name  that of a somnour may no good be sayd; i praye that noon of you be yvel apayd. a somnour is a renner up and doun with mandements for fornicacioun  and is ybet at every tounes ende.  our host tho spak a! sire ye sholde be hende and curteys as a man of your estaat; in companye we wol have no debaat. telleth your tale and lat the somnour be. nay quod the somnour lat him seye to me  what so him list; whan it comth to my lot by god i shal him quyten every grot. i shal him tellen which a greet honour  it is to be a flateringe limitour; t.  and his offyce i shal him telle ywis. t.  our host answerde pees namore of this.  and after this he seyde unto the frere tel forth your tale leve maister deere. here endeth the prologe of the frere. here biginneth the freres tale. whilom ther was dwellinge in my contree an erchedeken a man of heigh degree  that boldely dide execucioun in punisshinge of fornicacioun of wicchecraft and eek of bauderye of diffamacioun and avoutrye of chirchereves and of testaments  of contractes and of lakke of sacraments and eek of many another maner cryme t. om. which nedeth nat rehercen at this tyme; t. om. of usure and of symonye also.  but certes lechours dide he grettest wo;  they sholde singen if that they were hent; and smale tytheres weren foule yshent. if any persone wolde upon hem pleyne ther mighte asterte him no pecunial peyne. for smale tythes and for smal offringe  he made the peple pitously to singe. for er the bisshop caughte hem with his hook they weren in the erchedeknes book.  thanne hadde he thurgh his iurisdiccioun power to doon on hem correccioun.  he hadde a somnour redy to his hond a slyer boy was noon in engelond; for subtilly he hadde his espiaille that taughte him wher that him mighte availle. he coude spare of lechours oon or two  to techen him to foure and twenty mo. for thogh this somnour wood were as an hare to telle his harlotrye i wol nat spare;  for we been out of his correccioun; they han of us no iurisdiccioun  ne never shullen terme of alle hir lyves. peter! so been the wommen of the styves quod the somnour yput out of my cure! pees with mischance and with misaventure thus seyde our host and lat him telle his tale.  now telleth forth thogh that the somnour gale ne spareth nat myn owene maister dere. this false theef this somnour quod the frere  hadde alwey baudes redy to his hond as any hauk to lure in engelond  that tolde him al the secree that they knewe; for hir acqueyntance was nat come ofnewe. they weren hise approwours prively; he took himself a greet profit therby; his maister knew nat alwey what he wan.  withouten mandement a lewed man he coude somne on peyne of cristes curs and they were gladde for to fille his purs  and make him grete festes atte nale. and right as iudas hadde purses smale  and was a theef right swich a theef was he; his maister hadde but half his duetee. he was if i shal yeven him his laude a theef and eek a somnour and a baude. he hadde eek wenches at his retenue  that whether that sir robert or sir huwe or iakke or rauf or whoso that it were that lay by hem they tolde it in his ere;  thus was the wenche and he of oon assent. and he wolde fecche a feyned mandement  and somne hem to the chapitre bothe two and pile the man and lete the wenche go. thanne wolde he seye frend i shal for thy sake do stryken hir out of our lettres blake; thee thar namore as in this cas travaille;  i am thy freend ther i thee may availle. certeyn he knew of bryberyes mo than possible is to telle in yeres two.  for in this world nis dogge for the bowe that can an hurt deer from an hool yknowe  bet than this somnour knew a sly lechour or an avouter or a paramour. and for that was the fruit of al his rente therfore on it he sette al his entente. and so bifel that ones on a day  this somnour ever waiting on his pray rood for to somne a widwe an old ribybe feynynge a cause for he wolde brybe.  and happed that he saugh bifore him ryde a gay yeman under a forestsyde.  a bowe he bar and arwes brighte and kene; he hadde upon a courtepy of grene; an hat upon his heed with frenges blake. sir quod this somnour hayl! and wel atake! welcome quod he and every good felawe!  wher rydestow under this grene shawe? seyde this yeman wiltow fer to day? this somnour him answerde and seyde nay;  heer faste by quod he is myn entente to ryden for to reysen up a rente  that longeth to my lordes duetee. artow thanne a bailly? ye! quod he. he dorste nat for verray filthe and shame seye that he was a somnour for the name. depardieux quod this yeman dere brother  thou art a bailly and i am another. i am unknowen as in this contree; of thyn aqueyntance i wolde praye thee  and eek of brotherhede if that yow leste. i have gold and silver in my cheste;  if that thee happe to comen in our shyre al shal be thyn right as thou wolt desyre. grantmercy quod this somnour by my feith! everich in otheres hand his trouthe leith for to be sworne bretheren til they deye.  in daliance they ryden forth hir weye. this somnour which that was as ful of iangles as ful of venim been thise wariangles no and ever enquering upon every thing brother quod he where is now your dwelling  another day if that i sholde yow seche? this yeman him answerde in softe speche brother quod he fer in the north contree wher as i hope somtyme i shal thee see. er we departe i shal thee so wel wisse  that of myn hous ne shaltow never misse. now brother quod this somnour i yow preye teche me whyl that we ryden by the weye  sin that ye been a baillif as am i som subtiltee and tel me feithfully  in myn offyce how i may most winne; and spareth nat for conscience ne sinne but as my brother tel me how do ye? now by my trouthe brother dere seyde he as i shal tellen thee a feithful tale  my wages been ful streite and ful smale. my lord is hard to me and daungerous and myn offyce is ful laborous;  and therfore by extorcions i live. for sothe i take al that men wol me yive;  algate by sleyghte or by violence fro yeer to yeer i winne al my dispence. i can no bettre telle feithfully. now certes quod this somnour so fare i; i spare nat to taken god it woot  butif it be to hevy or to hoot. what i may gete in conseil prively no maner conscience of that have i;  nere myn extorcioun i mighte nat liven ne of swiche iapes wol i nat be shriven.  stomak ne conscience ne knowe i noon; i shrewe thise shriftefadres everichoon. wel be we met by god and by seint iame! but leve brother tel me than thy name quod this somnour; and in this menewhyle  this yeman gan a litel for to smyle. brother quod he wiltow that i thee telle? i am a feend my dwelling is in helle.  and here i ryde about my purchasing to wite wher men wolde yeve me any thing.  my purchas is theffect of al my rente. loke how thou rydest for the same entente to winne good thou rekkest never how; right so fare i for ryde wolde i now unto the worldes ende for a preye.  a quod this somnour benedicite what sey ye? i wende ye were a yeman trewely. ye han a mannes shap as wel as i;  han ye figure than determinat in helle ther ye been in your estat?  nay certeinly quod he ther have we noon; but whan us lyketh we can take us oon or elles make yow seme we ben shape somtyme lyk a man or lyk an ape; or lyk an angel can i ryde or go.  it is no wonder thing thogh it be so; a lousy iogelour can deceyve thee and pardee yet can i more craft than he.  why quod the somnour ryde ye thanne or goon in sondry shap and nat alwey in oon?  for we quod he wol us swich formes make as most able is our preyes for to take. what maketh yow to han al this labour? ful many a cause leve sir somnour seyde this feend but alle thing hath tyme.  the day is short and it is passed pryme and yet ne wan i nothing in this day. i wol entende to winnen if i may  and nat entende our wittes to declare. for brother myn thy wit is al to bare  to understonde althogh i tolde hem thee. but for thou axest why labouren we; for somtyme we ben goddes instruments and menes to don his comandements whan that him list upon his creatures  in divers art and in divers figures. withouten him we have no might certayn if that him list to stonden theragayn.  and somtyme at our prayere han we leve only the body and nat the soule greve;  witnesse on iob whom that we diden wo. and somtyme han we might of bothe two this is to seyn of soule and body eke. and somtyme be we suffred for to seke upon a man and doon his soule unreste  and nat his body and al is for the beste. whan he withstandeth our temptacioun it is a cause of his savacioun;  albeit that it was nat our entente he sholde be sauf but that we wolde him hente.  and somtyme be we servant unto man as to the erchebisshop seint dunstan and to the apostles servant eek was i. yet tel me quod the somnour feithfully make ye yow newe bodies thus alway  of elements? the feend answerde nay; somtyme we feyne and somtyme we aryse with dede bodies in ful sondry wyse  and speke as renably and faire and wel as to the phitonissa dide samuel.  and yet wol som men seye it was nat he; i do no fors of your divinitee. but o thing warne i thee i wol nat iape thou wolt algates wite how we ben shape; thou shalt herafterward my brother dere  com ther thee nedeth nat of me to lere. for thou shalt by thyn owene experience conne in a chayer rede of this sentence  bet than virgyle whyl he was on lyve or dant also; now lat us ryde blyve.  for i wol holde companye with thee til it be so that thou forsake me. nay quod this somnour that shal nat bityde; i am a yeman knowen is ful wyde; my trouthe wol i holde as in this cas.  for though thou were the devel sathanas my trouthe wol i holde to my brother as i am sworn and ech of us til other  for to be trewe brother in this cas; and bothe we goon abouten our purchas.  tak thou thy part what that men wol thee yive and i shal myn; thus may we bothe live. and if that any of us have more than other lat him be trewe and parte it with his brother. i graunte quod the devel by my fey.  and with that word they ryden forth hir wey. and right at the entring of the tounes ende to which this somnour shoop him for to wende  they saugh a cart that charged was with hey which that a carter droof forth in his wey.  deep was the wey for which the carte stood. the carter smoot and cryde as he were wood hayt brok! hayt scot! what spare ye for the stones? the feend quod he yow fecche body and bones as ferforthly as ever were ye foled!  so muche wo as i have with yow tholed! the devel have al bothe hors and cart and hey! this somnour seyde heer shal we have a pley;

the leoun sit in his await alway to slee the innocent if that he may.  disposeth ay your hertes to withstonde the feend that yow wolde make thral and bonde.  he may nat tempten yow over your might; for crist wol be your champion and knight. and prayeth that thise somnours hem repente of hir misdedes er that the feend hem hente. here endeth the freres tale. the prologe of the somnours tale. this somnour in his stiropes hye stood;  upon this frere his herte was so wood that lyk an aspen leef he quook for yre. lordinges quod he but o thing i desyre; i yow biseke that of your curteisye sin ye han herd this false frere lye  as suffereth me i may my tale telle! this frere bosteth that he knoweth helle and god it woot that it is litel wonder; freres and feendes been but lyte asonder.  for pardee ye han ofte tyme herd telle  how that a frere ravisshed was to helle in spirit ones by a visioun; and as an angel ladde him up and doun to shewen him the peynes that ther were in al the place saugh he nat a frere;  of other folk he saugh ynowe in wo. unto this angel spak the frere tho: now sir quod he han freres swich a grace that noon of hem shal come to this place?  yis quod this angel many a millioun!  and unto sathanas he ladde him doun. and now hath sathanas seith he a tayl brodder than of a carrik is the sayl. hold up thy tayl thou sathanas! quod he shewe forth thyn ers and lat the frere see  wher is the nest of freres in this place! and er that half a furlongwey of space right so as bees out swarmen from an hyve out of the develes ers ther gonne dryve  twenty thousand freres in a route  and thurghout helle swarmeden aboute; and comen agayn as faste as they may gon and in his ers they crepten everichon. he clapte his tayl agayn and lay ful stille. this frere whan he loked hadde his fille  upon the torments of this sory place his spirit god restored of his grace unto his body agayn and he awook; but natheles for fere yet he quook  so was the develes ers ay in his minde  that is his heritage of verray kinde. god save yow alle save this cursed frere; my prologe wol i ende in this manere. here endeth the prologe of the somnours tale. here biginneth the somonour his tale. lordinges ther is in yorkshire as i gesse a mersshy contree called holdernesse  in which ther wente a limitour aboute to preche and eek to begge it is no doute. and so bifel that on a day this frere had preched at a chirche in his manere and specially aboven every thing  excited he the peple in his preching to trentals and to yeve for goddes sake wherwith men mighten holy houses make  ther as divyne service is honoured nat ther as it is wasted and devoured  ne ther it nedeth nat for to be yive as to possessioners that mowen live thanked be god in wele and habundaunce. trentals seyde he deliveren fro penaunce hir freendes soules as wel olde as yonge  ye whan that they been hastily ysonge; nat for to holde a preest ioly and gay he singeth nat but o masse in a day;  delivereth out quod he anon the soules; ful hard it is with fleshhook or with oules  to been yclawed or to brenne or bake; now spede yow hastily for cristes sake. and whan this frere had seyd al his entente with qui cum patre forth his wey he wente. whan folk in chirche had yeve him what hem leste  he wente his wey no lenger wolde he reste with scrippe and tipped staf ytukked hye; in every hous he gan to poure and prye  and beggeth mele and chese or elles corn. his felawe hadde a staf tipped with horn  a peyre of tables al of yvory and a poyntel polisshed fetisly and wroot the names alwey as he stood of alle folk that yaf him any good ascaunces that he wolde for hem preye.  yeve us a busshel whete malt or reye a goddes kechil or a trip of chese or elles what yow list we may nat chese;

he served hem with nyfles and with fables.  nay ther thou lixt thou somnour quod the frere. pees quod our host for cristes moder dere; tel forth thy tale and spare it nat at al. so thryve i quod this somnour so i shal. so longe he wente hous by hous til he  cam til an hous ther he was wont to be refresshed more than in an hundred placis. sik lay the gode man whos that the place is;  bedrede upon a couche lowe he lay. deus hic quod he o thomas freend good day  seyde this frere curteisly and softe. thomas quod he god yelde yow! ful ofte have i upon this bench faren ful weel. here have i eten many a mery meel; and fro the bench he droof awey the cat  and leyde adoun his potente and his hat and eek his scrippe and sette him softe adoun. his felawe was go walked into toun  forth with his knave into that hostelrye wheras he shoop him thilke night to lye.  o dere maister quod this syke man how han ye fare sith that march bigan? i saugh yow noght this fourtenight or more. god woot quod he laboured have i ful sore; and specially for thy savacioun  have i seyd many a precious orisoun and for our othere frendes god hem blesse! i have today been at your chirche at messe  and seyd a sermon after my simple wit nat al after the text of holy writ;  for it is hard to yow as i suppose and therfore wol i teche yow al the glose. glosinge is a glorious thing certeyn for lettre sleeth so as we clerkes seyn. ther have i taught hem to be charitable  and spende hir good ther it is resonable and ther i saugh our dame; a! wher is she? yond in the yerd i trowe that she be  seyde this man and she wol come anon. ey maister! welcome be ye by seint iohn!  seyde this wyf how fare ye hertely? the frere aryseth up ful curteisly and hir embraceth in his armes narwe and kiste hir swete and chirketh as a sparwe with his lippes: dame quod he right weel  as he that is your servant every deel. thanked be god that yow yaf soule and lyf yet saugh i nat this day so fair a wyf  in al the chirche god so save me! ye god amende defautes sir quod she  algates welcome be ye by my fey! graunt mercy dame this have i founde alwey. but of your grete goodnesse by your leve i wolde prey yow that ye nat yow greve i wol with thomas speke a litel throwe.  thise curats been ful necligent and slowe to grope tendrely a conscience. in shrift in preching is my diligence  and studie in petres wordes and in poules. i walke and fisshe cristen mennes soules  to yelden iesu crist his propre rente; to sprede his word is set al myn entente. now by your leve o dere sir quod she chydeth him weel for seinte trinitee. he is as angry as a pissemyre  though that he have al that he can desyre. though i him wrye anight and make him warm and on hym leye my leg outher myn arm  he groneth lyk our boor lyth in our sty. other desport right noon of him have i;  i may nat plese him in no maner cas. o thomas! ie vous dy thomas! thomas! this maketh the feend this moste ben amended. ire is a thing that hye god defended and therof wol i speke a word or two.  now maister quod the wyf er that i go what wol ye dyne? i wol go theraboute. now dame quod he ie vous dy sanz doute  have i nat of a capon but the livere and of your softe breed nat but a shivere  and after that a rosted pigges heed but that i nolde no beest for me were deed thanne hadde i with yow hoomly suffisaunce. i am a man of litel sustenaunce. my spirit hath his fostring in the bible.  the body is ay so redy and penyble to wake that my stomak is destroyed. i prey yow dame ye be nat anoyed  though i so freendly yow my conseil shewe; by god i wolde nat telle it but a fewe.  now sir quod she but o word er i go; my child is deed withinne thise wykes two sone after that ye wente out of this toun. his deeth saugh i by revelacioun seith this frere at hoom in our dortour.  i dar wel seyn that er that half an hour after his deeth i saugh him born to blisse in myn avisioun so god me wisse!  so dide our sexteyn and our fermerer that han been trewe freres fifty yeer;  they may now god be thanked of his lone maken hir iubilee and walke allone. and up i roos and al our covent eke with many a tere trikling on my cheke withouten noyse or clateringe of belles;  te deum was our song and nothing elles save that to crist i seyde an orisoun thankinge him of his revelacioun.  for sir and dame trusteth me right weel our orisons been more effectueel  and more we seen of cristes secree thinges than burel folk although they weren kinges. we live in povert and in abstinence and burel folk in richesse and despence of mete and drinke and in hir foul delyt.  we han this worldes lust al in despyt. lazar and dives liveden diversly and diverse guerdon hadden they therby.  whoso wol preye he moot faste and be clene and fatte his soule and make his body lene.  we fare as seith thapostle; cloth and fode suffysen us though they be nat ful gode. the clennesse and the fastinge of us freres maketh that crist accepteth our preyeres. lo moyses fourty dayes and fourty night  fasted er that the heighe god of might spak with him in the mountain of sinay. with empty wombe fastinge many a day  receyved he the lawe that was writen with goddes finger; and elie wel ye witen  in mount oreb er he hadde any speche with hye god that is our lyves leche he fasted longe and was in contemplaunce. aaron that hadde the temple in governaunce and eek the othere preestes everichon  into the temple whan they sholde gon to preye for the peple and do servyse they nolden drinken in no maner wyse  no drinke which that mighte hem dronke make but there in abstinence preye and wake  lest that they deyden; tak heed what i seye. but they be sobre that for the peple preye war that i seyenamore! for it suffyseth. our lord iesu as holy writ devyseth yaf us ensample of fastinge and preyeres.  therfor we mendinants we sely freres been wedded to poverte and continence to charitee humblesse and abstinence  to persecucion for rightwisnesse to wepinge misericorde and clennesse.  and therfor may ye see that our preyeres i speke of us we mendinants we freres ben to the hye god more acceptable than youres with your festes at the table. fro paradys first if i shal nat lye  was man out chaced for his glotonye; and chaast was man in paradys certeyn. but herkne now thomas what i shal seyn.  i ne have no text of it as i suppose but i shall finde it in a maner glose  that specially our swete lord iesus spak this by freres whan he seyde thus: blessed be they that povre in spirit been. and so forth al the gospel may ye seen wher it be lyker our professioun  or hirs that swimmen in possessioun. fy on hir pompe and on hir glotonye! and for hir lewednesse i hem diffye.  me thinketh they ben lyk iovinian fat as a whale and walkinge as a swan;  al vinolent as botel in the spence. hir preyer is of ful gret reverence; whan they for soules seye the psalm of davit lo buf! they seye cor meum eructavit! who folweth cristes gospel and his fore  but we that humble been and chast and pore werkers of goddes word not auditours? therfore right as an hauk up at a sours  up springeth into their right so prayeres of charitable and chaste bisy freres  maken hir sours to goddes eres two. thomas! thomas! so mote i ryde or go and by that lord that clepid is seint yve nere thou our brother sholdestou nat thryve! in our chapitre praye we day and night  to crist that he thee sende hele and might thy body for to welden hastily. god woot quod he nothing therof fele i;  as help me crist as i in fewe yeres han spended upon dyvers maner freres  ful many a pound; yet fare i never the bet. certeyn my good have i almost biset. farwel my gold! for it is al ago! the frere answerde o thomas dostow so? what nedeth yow diverse freres seche?  what nedeth him that hath a parfit leche to sechen othere leches in the toun? your inconstance is your confusioun.  holde ye than me or elles our covent to praye for yow ben insufficient?  thomas that iape nis nat worth a myte; your maladye is for we han to lyte. a! yif that covent half a quarter otes! a! yif that covent four and twenty grotes! a! yif that frere a peny and lat him go!  nay nay thomas! it may nothing be so. what is a ferthing worth parted in twelve? lo ech thing that is oned in himselve  is more strong than whan it is toscatered. thomas of me thou shalt nat been yflatered;  thou woldest han our labour al for noght. the hye god that al this world hath wroght seith that the werkman worthy is his hyre. thomas! noght of your tresor i desyre as for myself but that al our covent  to preye for yow is ay so diligent and for to builden cristes owene chirche. thomas! if ye wol lernen for to wirche  of buildinge up of chirches may ye finde if it be good in thomas lyf of inde.  ye lye heer ful of anger and of yre with which the devel set your herte afyre and chyden heer this sely innocent your wyf that is so meke and pacient. and therfor thomas trowe me if thee leste  ne stryve nat with thy wyf as for thy beste; and ber this word awey now by thy feith touchinge this thing lo what the wyse seith:  within thyn hous ne be thou no leoun; to thy subgits do noon oppressioun;  ne make thyne aqueyntances nat to flee. and thomas yet eftsones i charge thee be war from hir that in thy bosom slepeth; war fro the serpent that so slyly crepeth under the gras and stingeth subtilly.  be war my sone and herkne paciently that twenty thousand men han lost hir lyves for stryving with hir lemmans and hir wyves.  now sith ye han so holy and meke a wyf what nedeth yow thomas to maken stryf?  ther nis ywis no serpent so cruel whan man tret on his tayl ne half so fel as womman is whan she hath caught an ire; vengeance is thanne al that they desyre. ire is a sinne oon of the grete of sevene  abhominable unto the god of hevene; and to himself it is destruccion. this every lewed viker or person  can seye how ire engendreth homicyde. ire is in sooth executour of pryde.  i coude of ire seye so muche sorwe my tale sholde laste til tomorwe. and therfor preye i god bothe day and night an irous man god sende him litel might! it is greet harm and certes gret pitee  to sette an irous man in heigh degree. whilom ther was an irous potestat as seith senek that duringe his estaat  upon a day out riden knightes two and as fortune wolde that it were so  that oon of hem cam hoom that other noght. anon the knight bifore the iuge is broght that seyde thus thou hast thy felawe slayn for which i deme thee to the deeth certayn. and to another knight comanded he  go lede him to the deeth i charge thee. and happed as they wente by the weye toward the place ther he sholde deye  the knight cam which men wenden had be deed. thanne thoughte they it was the beste reed  to lede hem bothe to the iuge agayn. they seiden lord the knight ne hath nat slayn his felawe; here he standeth hool alyve. ye shul be deed quod he so moot i thryve! that is to seyn bothe oon and two and three!  and to the firste knight right thus spak he i dampned thee thou most algate be deed. and thou also most nedes lese thyn heed  for thou art cause why thy felawe deyth. and to the thridde knight right thus he seyth  thou hast nat doon that i comanded thee. and thus he dide don sleen hem alle three. irous cambyses was eek dronkelewe and ay delyted him to been a shrewe. and so bifel a lord of his meynee  that lovede vertuous moralitee seyde on a day bitwix hem two right thus: a lord is lost if he be vicious;  and dronkenesse is eek a foul record of any man and namely in a lord.  ther is ful many an eye and many an ere awaiting on a lord and he noot where. for goddes love drink more attemprely; wyn maketh man to lesen wrecchedly his minde and eek his limes everichon.  the revers shaltou se quod he anon; and preve it by thyn owene experience that wyn ne dooth to folk no swich offence.  ther is no wyn bireveth me my might of hand ne foot ne of myn eyen sight  and for despyt he drank ful muchel more an hondred part than he had doon bifore; and right anon this irous cursed wrecche leet this knightes sone bifore him fecche comandinge him he sholde bifore him stonde.  and sodeynly he took his bowe in honde and up the streng he pulled to his ere and with an arwe he slow the child right there:  now whether have i a siker hand or noon? quod he is al my might and minde agoon?  hath wyn bireved me myn eyen sight? what sholde i telle thanswere of the knight? his sone was slayn ther is namore to seye. beth war therfor with lordes how ye pleye. singeth placebo and i shal if i can  but if it be unto a povre man. to a povre man men sholde hise vyces telle but nat to a lord thogh he sholde go to helle.  lo irous cirus thilke percien how he destroyed the river of gysen  for that an hors of his was dreynt therinne whan that he wente babiloigne to winne. he made that the river was so smal that wommen mighte wade it over al. lo what seyde he that so wel teche can?  ne be no felawe to an irous man ne with no wood man walke by the weye lest thee repente; ther is namore to seye.  now thomas leve brother lef thyn ire; thou shall me finde as iust as is a squire.  hold nat the develes knyf ay at thyn herte; thyn angre dooth thee al to sore smerte; but shewe to me al thy confessioun. nay quod the syke man by seint simoun! i have be shriven this day at my curat;  i have him told al hoolly myn estat; nedeth namore to speke of it seith he but if me list of myn humilitee.  yif me thanne of thy gold to make our cloistre quod he for many a muscle and many an oistre  whan other men han ben ful wel at eyse hath been our fode our cloistre for to reyse. and yet god woot unnethe the fundement parfourned is ne of our pavement nis nat a tyle yet withinne our wones;  by god we owen fourty pound for stones! now help thomas for him that harwed helle! for elles moste we our bokes selle.  and if ye lakke our predicacioun than gooth the world al to destruccioun.  for whoso wolde us fro this world bireve so god me save thomas by your leve he wolde bireve out of this world the sonne. for who can teche and werchen as we conne? and that is nat of litel tyme quod he;  but sith that elie was or elisee han freres been that finde i of record in charitee ythanked be our lord.  now thomas help for seinte charitee! and doun anon he sette him on his knee.  this syke man wex wel ny wood for ire; he wolde that the frere had been onfire with his false dissimulacioun. swich thing as is in my possessioun quod he that may i yeven and non other.  ye sey me thus how that i am your brother? ye certes quod the frere trusteth weel; i took our dame our lettre with our seel.  now wel quod he and somwhat shal i yive unto your holy covent whyl i live  and in thyn hand thou shalt it have anoon; on this condicioun and other noon that thou departe it so my dere brother that every frere have also muche as other. this shaltou swere on thy professioun  withouten fraude or cavillacioun. i swere it quod this frere upon my feith! and therwithal his hand in his he leith:  lo heer my feith! in me shal be no lak. now thanne put thyn hand doun by my bak  seyde this man and grope wel bihinde; bynethe my buttok ther shaltow finde a thing that i have hid in privetee. a! thoghte this frere this shal go with me! and doun his hand he launcheth to the clifte  in hope for to finde ther a yifte. and whan this syke man felte this frere aboute his tuwel grope there and here  amidde his hand he leet the frere a fart. ther nis no capul drawinge in a cart  that mighte have lete a fart of swich a soun. the frere up stirte as doth a wood leoun: a! false cherl quod he for goddes bones this hastow for despyt doon for the nones! thou shalt abye this fart if that i may!  his meynee whiche that herden this affray cam lepinge in and chaced out the frere; and forth he gooth with a ful angry chere  and fette his felawe theras lay his stoor. he looked as it were a wilde boor;  he grinte with his teeth so was he wrooth. a sturdy pas doun to the court he gooth wheras ther woned a man of greet honour to whom that he was alwey confessour; this worthy man was lord of that village.  this frere cam as he were in a rage wheras this lord sat eting at his bord. unnethes mighte the frere speke a word  til atte laste he seyde: god yow see! this lord gan loke and seide benedicite!  what frere iohn what maner world is this? i see wel that som thing ther is amis. ye loken as the wode were ful of thevis sit doun anon and tel me what your greef is and it shal been amended if i may.  i have quod he had a despyt this day god yelde yow! adoun in your village that in this world is noon so povre a page  that he nolde have abhominacioun of that i have receyved in your toun.  and yet ne greveth me nothing so sore as that this olde cherl with lokkes hore blasphemed hath our holy covent eke. now maister quod this lord i yow biseke. no maister sire quod he but servitour  thogh i have had in scole swich honour. god lyketh nat that raby men us calle neither in market ne in your large halle.  no fors quod he but tel me al your grief. sire quod this frere an odious meschief  this day bitid is to myn ordre and me and so per consequens to ech degree of holy chirche god amende it sone! sir quod the lord ye woot what is to done. distempre yow noght ye be my confessour;  ye been the salt of the erthe and the savour. for goddes love your pacience ye holde; tel me your grief: and he anon him tolde  as ye han herd biforn ye woot wel what. the lady of the hous ay stille sat  til she had herd al what the frere sayde: ey goddes moder quod she blisful mayde! is ther oght elles? telle me faithfully. madame quod he how thinketh yow herby? how that me thinketh? quod she; so god me speede i seye a cherl hath doon a cherles dede. what shold i seye? god lat him never thee! his syke heed is ful of vanitee  i hold him in a maner frenesye. madame quod he by god i shal nat lye;  but i on other weyes may be wreke i shal diffame him overal ther i speke this false blasphemour that charged me to parte that wol nat departed be to every man yliche with meschaunce!  the lord sat stille as he were in a traunce and in his herte he rolled up and doun how hadde this cherl imaginacioun  to shewe swich a probleme to the frere? never erst er now herde i of swich matere;  i trowe the devel putte it in his minde. in arsmetryke shal ther no man finde biforn this day of swich a questioun. who sholde make a demonstracioun that every man sholde have yliche his part  as of the soun or savour of a fart? o nyce proude cherl i shrewe his face! lo sires quod the lord with harde grace  who ever herde of swich a thing er now? to every man ylyke? tel me how?  it is an inpossible it may nat be! ey nyce cherl god lete him never thee! the rumblinge of a fart and every soun nis but of eir reverberacioun and ever it wasteth lyte and lyte awey.  ther is no man can demen by my fey if that it were departed equally. what lo my cherl lo yet how shrewedly  unto my confessour today he spak! i holde him certeyn a demoniak!  now ete your mete and lat the cherl go pleye lat him go honge himself a devel weye! now stood the lordes squyer at the bord that carf his mete and herde word by word of alle thinges of which i have yow sayd.  my lord quod he be ye nat yvel apayd; i coude telle for a gouneclooth to yow sir frere so ye be nat wrooth  how that this fart sholde even deled be among your covent if it lyked me.  tel quod the lord and thou shall have anon a gounecloth by god and by seint iohn! my lord quod he whan that the weder is fair withouten wind or perturbinge of air lat bringe a cartwheel here into this halle  but loke that it have his spokes alle. twelf spokes hath a cartwheel comunly. and bring me than twelf freres woot ye why?  for thrittene is a covent as i gesse. the confessour heer for his worthinesse  shal parfourne up the nombre of his covent. than shal they knele doun by oon assent and to every spokes ende in this manere ful sadly leye his nose shal a frere. your noble confessour ther god him save  shal holde his nose upright under the nave. than shal this cherl with bely stif and toght as any tabour hider been ybroght;  and sette him on the wheel right of this cart upon the nave and make him lete a fart.  and ye shul seen up peril of my lyf by preve which that is demonstratif that equally the soun of it wol wende and eek the stink unto the spokes ende; save that this worthy man your confessour  bycause he is a man of greet honour shal have the firste fruit as reson is; the noble usage of freres yet is this  the worthy men of hem shul first be served; and certeinly he hath it weel deserved.  he hath today taught us so muchel good with preching in the pulpit ther he stood that i may vouchesauf i sey for me he hadde the firste smel of fartes three and so wolde al his covent hardily;  he bereth him so faire and holily. the lord the lady and ech man save the frere seyde that iankin spak in this matere  as wel as euclide or as ptholomee. touchinge this cherl they seyde subtiltee  and heigh wit made him speken as he spak; he nis no fool ne no demoniak. and iankin hath ywonne a newe goune. my tale is doon; we been almost at toune.  here endeth the somnours tale. here folweth the prologe of the clerkes tale of oxenford. sir clerk of oxenford our hoste sayde ye ryde as coy and stille as dooth a mayde were newe spoused sitting at the bord;

ye han of us as now the governaunce and therfor wol i do yow obeisaunce as fer as reson axeth hardily.  i wol yow telle a tale which that i lerned at padowe of a worthy clerk as preved by his wordes and his werk. he is now deed and nayled in his cheste i prey to god so yeve his soule reste!  fraunceys petrark the laureat poete highte this clerk whos rethoryke sweete enlumined al itaille of poetrye as linian dide of philosophye or lawe or other art particuler;  but deeth that wol nat suffre us dwellen heer but as it were a twinkling of an ye hem bothe hath slayn and alle shul we dye. but forth to tellen of this worthy man that taughte me this tale as i bigan  i seye that first with heigh style he endyteth er he the body of his tale wryteth a proheme in the which discryveth he pemond and of saluces the contree and speketh of apennyn the hilles hye  that been the boundes of west lumbardye and of mount vesulus in special where as the poo out of a welle smal taketh his firste springing and his sours that estward ay encresseth in his cours  to emelward to ferrare and venyse: the which a long thing were to devyse. and trewely as to my iugement me thinketh it a thing impertinent save that he wol convey en his matere:  but this his tale which that ye may here. here biginneth the tale of the clerk of oxenford. ther is at the west syde of itaille doun at the rote of vesulus the colde a lusty playne habundant of vitaille wher many a tour and toun thou mayst biholde  that founded were in tyme of fadres olde and many another delitable sighte and saluces this noble contree highte. a markis whylom lord was of that londe as were his worthy eldres him bifore;  and obeisant and redy to his honde  were alle his liges bothe lasse and more. thus in delyt he liveth and hath don yore biloved and drad thurgh favour of fortune bothe of his lordes and of his commune.  therwith he was to speke as of linage the gentilleste yborn of lumbardye a fair persone and strong and yong of age and ful of honour and of curteisye; discreet ynogh his contree for to gye  save in somme thinges that he was to blame  and walter was this yonge lordes name. i blame him thus that he considereth noght in tyme cominge what mighte him bityde but on his lust present was al his thoght  as for to hauke and hunte on every syde; wel ny alle othere cures leet he slyde and eek he nolde and that was worst of alle wedde no wyf for noght that may bifalle. only that point his peple bar so sore  that flokmele on a day they to him wente  and oon of hem that wysest was of lore or elles that the lord best wolde assente that he sholde telle him what his peple mente or elles coude he shewe wel swich matere  he to the markis seyde as ye shul here. o noble markis your humanitee assureth us and yeveth us hardinesse as ofte as tyme is of necessitee that we to yow mowe telle our hevinesse;  accepteth lord now for your gentillesse  that we with pitous herte unto yow pleyne and lete your eres nat my voys disdeyne. al have i noght to done in this matere more than another man hath in this place  yet for as muche as ye my lord so dere han alwey shewed me favour and grace i dar the better aske of yow a space of audience to shewen our requeste and ye my lord to doon right as yow leste.  for certes lord so wel us lyketh yow  and al your werk and ever han doon that we ne coude nat us self devysen how we mighte liven in more felicitee save o thing lord if it your wille be  that for to been a wedded man yow leste than were your peple in sovereyn hertes reste. boweth your nekke under that blisful yok of soveraynetee noght of servyse which that men clepeth spousaille or wedlok;  and thenketh lord among your thoghtes wyse  how that our dayes passe in sondry wyse; for though we slepe or wake or rome or ryde ay fleeth the tyme it nil no man abyde. and though your grene youthe floure as yit  in crepeth age alwey as stille as stoon and deeth manaceth every age and smit in ech estaat for ther escapeth noon: and al so certein as we knowe echoon that we shul deye as uncerteyn we alle  been of that day whan deeth shal on us falle.  accepteth than of us the trewe entente that never yet refuseden your heste and we wol lord if that ye wol assente chese yow a wyf in short tyme atte leste  born of the gentilleste and of the meste of al this lond so that it oghte seme honour to god and yow as we can deme. deliver us out of al this bisy drede and tak a wyf for hye goddes sake;  for if it so bifelle as god forbede  that thurgh your deeth your linage sholde slake and that a straunge successour sholde take your heritage o! wo were us alyve! wherfor we pray you hastily to wyve.  hir meke preyere and hir pitous chere made the markis herte han pitee. ye wol quod he myn owene peple dere to that i never erst thoghte streyne me. i me reioysed of my libertee  that selde tyme is founde in mariage;  ther i was free i moot been in servage. but nathelees i see your trewe entente and truste upon your wit and have don ay; wherfor of my free wil i wol assente  to wedde me as sone as ever i may. but theras ye han profred me today to chese me a wyf i yow relesse that choys and prey yow of that profre cesse. for god it woot that children ofte been  unlyk her worthy eldres hem bifore;

but i yow preye and charge upon your lyf that what wyf that i take ye me assure  to worshipe hir whyl that hir lyf may dure  in word and werk bothe here and everywhere as she an emperoures doghter were. and forthermore this shal ye swere that ye agayn my choys shul neither grucche ne stryve;  for sith i shal forgoon my libertee at your requeste as ever moot i thryve ther as myn herte is set ther wol i wyve; and but ye wole assente in swich manere i prey yow speketh namore of this matere.  with hertly wil they sworen and assenten  to al this thing ther seyde no wight nay; bisekinge him of grace er that they wenten that he wolde graunten hem a certein day of his spousaille as sone as ever he may;  for yet alwey the peple somwhat dredde lest that this markis no wyf wolde wedde. he graunted hem a day swich as him leste on which he wolde be wedded sikerly and seyde he dide al this at hir requeste;  and they with humble entente buxomly  knelinge upon her knees ful reverently him thanken alle and thus they han an ende of hir entente and hoom agayn they wende. and heerupon he to his officeres  comaundeth for the feste to purveye and to his privee knightes and squyeres swich charge yaf as him liste on hem leye; and they to his comandement obeye and ech of hem doth al his diligence  to doon unto the feste reverence.  explicit prima pars. incipit secunda pars. noght fer fro thilke paleys honurable theras this markis shoop his mariage ther stood a throp of site delitable in which that povre folk of that village  hadden hir bestes and hir herbergage and of hir labour took hir sustenance after that the erthe yaf hem habundance. amonges thise povre folk ther dwelte a man which that was holden povrest of hem alle;  but hye god som tyme senden can  his grace into a litel oxes stalle: ianicula men of that throp him calle. a doghter hadde he fair ynogh to sighte and grisildis this yonge mayden highte.  but for to speke of vertuous beautee than was she oon the faireste under sonne; for povreliche yfostred up was she no likerous lust was thurgh hir herte yronne; wel ofter of the welle than of the tonne  she drank and for she wolde vertu plese  she knew wel labour but non ydel ese. but thogh this mayde tendre were of age yet in the brest of hir virginitee ther was enclosed rype and sad corage;  and in greet reverence and charitee hir olde povre fader fostred she; a fewe sheep spinning on feeld she kepte she wolde noght been ydel til she slepte. and whan she hoomward cam she wolde bringe  wortes or othere herbes tymes ofte  the whiche she shredde and seeth for hir livinge and made hir bed ful harde and nothing softe; and ay she kepte hir fadres lyf onlofte with everich obeisaunce and diligence  that child may doon to fadres reverence. upon grisilde this povre creature ful ofte sythe this markis sette his ye as he on hunting rood paraventure; and whan it fil that he mighte hir espye  he noght with wantoun loking of folye  his yen caste on hir but in sad wyse upon hir chere he wolde him ofte avyse commending in his herte hir wommanhede and eek hir vertu passing any wight  of so yong age as wel in chere as dede. for thogh the peple have no greet insight in vertu he considered ful right hir bountee and disposed that he wolde wedde hir only if ever he wedde sholde.  the day of wedding cam but no wight can  telle what womman that it sholde be; for which merveille wondred many a man and seyden whan they were in privetee wol nat our lord yet leve his vanitee?  wol he nat wedde? allas allas the whyle! why wol he thus himself and us bigyle? but natheles this markis hath don make of gemmes set in gold and in asure broches and ringes for grisildis sake  and of hir clothing took he the mesure  by a mayde lyk to hir stature and eek of othere ornamentes alle that unto swich a wedding sholde falle. the tyme of undern of the same day  approcheth that this wedding sholde be; and al the paleys put was in array bothe halle and chambres ech in his degree; houses of office stuffed with plentee ther maystow seen of deyntevous vitaille  that may be founde as fer as last itaille.  this royal markis richely arrayed lordes and ladyes in his companye the whiche unto the feste were yprayed and of his retenue the bachelrye  with many a soun of sondry melodye unto the village of the which i tolde in this array the righte wey han holde. grisilde of this god woot ful innocent that for hir shapen was al this array  to fecchen water at a welle is went  and cometh hoom as sone as ever she may. for wel she hadde herd seyd that thilke day the markis sholde wedde and if she mighte she wolde fayn han seyn som of that sighte.  she thoghte i wol with othere maydens stonde that been my felawes in our dore and see the markisesse and therfor wol i fonde to doon at hoom as sone as it may be the labour which that longeth unto me;  and than i may at leyser hir biholde  if she this wey unto the castel holde. and as she wolde over hir threshfold goon the markis cam and gan hir for to calle; and she sette doun hir waterpot anoon  bisyde the threshfold in an oxes stalle and doun upon hir knees she gan to falle and with sad contenance kneleth stille til she had herd what was the lordes wille. this thoghtful markis spak unto this mayde  ful sobrely and seyde in this manere  wher is your fader grisildis? he sayde and she with reverence in humble chere answerde lord he is al redy here. and in she gooth withouten lenger lette  and to the markis she hir fader fette. he by the hond than took this olde man and seyde thus whan he him hadde asyde ianicula i neither may ne can lenger the plesance of myn herte hyde.  if that thou vouchesauf whatso bityde  thy doghter wol i take er that i wende as for my wyf unto hir lyves ende. thou lovest me i woot it wel certeyn and art my feithful lige man ybore;  and al that lyketh me i dar wel seyn it lyketh thee and specially therfore tel me that poynt that i have seyd bifore if that thou wolt unto that purpos drawe to take me as for thy soneinlawe?  this sodeyn cas this man astoned so  that reed he wex abayst and al quaking he stood unnethes seyde he wordes mo but only thus: lord quod he my willing is as ye wole ne ayeines your lyking  i wol nothing; ye be my lord so dere; right as yow lust governeth this matere. yet wol i quod this markis softely that in thy chambre i and thou and she have a collacion and wostow why?  for i wol axe if it hir wille be  to be my wyf and reule hir after me; and al this shal be doon in thy presence i wol noght speke out of thyn audience. and in the chambre whyl they were aboute  hir tretis which as ye shal after here the peple cam unto the hous withoute and wondred hem in how honest manere and tentifly she kepte hir fader dere. but outerly grisildis wondre mighte  for never erst ne saugh she swich a sighte.  no wonder is thogh that she were astoned to seen so greet a gest come in that place; she never was to swiche gestes woned for which she loked with ful pale face.  but shortly forth this tale for to chace thise arn the wordes that the markis sayde to this benigne verray feithful mayde. grisilde he seyde ye shul wel understonde it lyketh to your fader and to me  that i yow wedde and eek it may so stonde  as i suppose ye wol that it so be. but thise demandes axe i first quod he that sith it shal be doon in hastif wyse wol ye assente or elles yow avyse?  i seye this be ye redy with good herte to al my lust and that i frely may as me best thinketh do yow laughe or smerte and never ye to grucche it night ne day? and eek whan i sey ye ne sey nat nay  neither by word ne frowning contenance;  swer this and here i swere our alliance. wondring upon this word quaking for drede she seyde lord undigne and unworthy am i to thilke honour that ye me bede;  but as ye wol yourself right so wol i. and heer i swere that never willingly in werk ne thoght i nil yow disobeye for to be deed though me were looth to deye. this is ynogh grisilde myn! quod he.  and forth he gooth with a ful sobre chere  out at the dore and after that cam she and to the peple he seyde in this manere this is my wyf quod he that standeth here. honoureth hir and loveth hir i preye  whoso me loveth; ther is namore to seye. and for that nothing of hir olde gere she sholde bringe into his hous he bad that wommen sholde dispoilen hir right there; of which thise ladyes were nat right glad  to handle hir clothes wherin she was clad.  but natheles this mayde bright of hewe fro foot to heed they clothed han al newe. hir heres han they kembd that lay untressed ful rudely and with hir fingres smale  a corone on hir heed they han ydressed and sette hir ful of nowches grete and smale; of hir array what sholde i make a tale? unnethe the peple hir knew for hir fairnesse whan she translated was in swich richesse.  this markis hath hir spoused with a ring  broght for the same cause and than hir sette upon an hors snowwhyt and wel ambling and to his paleys er he lenger lette with ioyful peple that hir ladde and mette  conveyed hir and thus the day they spende in revel til the sonne gan descende. and shortly forth this tale for to chace i seye that to this newe markisesse god hath swich favour sent hir of his grace  that it ne semed nat by lyklinesse  that she was born and fed in rudenesse as in a cote or in an oxestalle but norished in an emperoures halle. to every wight she woxen is so dere  and worshipful that folk ther she was bore and from hir birthe knewe hir yeer by yere unnethe trowed they but dorste han swore that to ianicle of which i spak bifore she doghter nas for as by coniecture  hem thoughte she was another creature.  for thogh that ever vertuous was she she was encressed in swich excellence of thewes gode yset in heigh bountee and so discreet and fair of eloquence  so benigne and so digne of reverence and coude so the peples herte embrace that ech hir lovede that loked on hir face. noght only of saluces in the toun publiced was the bountee of hir name  but eek bisyde in many a regioun  if oon seyde wel another seyde the same; so spradde of hir heigh bountee the fame that men and wommen as wel yonge as olde gon to saluce upon hir to biholde.  thus walter lowly nay but royally wedded with fortunat honestetee in goddes pees liveth ful esily at hoom and outward grace ynogh had he; and for he saugh that under low degree  was ofte vertu hid the peple him helde  a prudent man and that is seyn ful selde. nat only this grisildis thurgh hir wit coude al the feet of wyfly hoomlinesse but eek whan that the cas requyred it  the commune profit coude she redresse. ther nas discord rancour ne hevinesse in al that lond that she ne coude apese and wysly bringe hem alle in reste and ese. though that hir housbonde absent were anoon  if gentil men or othere of hir contree  were wrothe she wolde bringen hem atoon; so wyse and rype wordes hadde she and iugements of so greet equitee that she from heven sent was as men wende  peple to save and every wrong tamende. nat longe tyme after that this grisild was wedded she a doughter hath ybore al had hir lever have born a knave child. glad was this markis and the folk therfore;  for though a mayde child come al bifore  she may unto a knave child atteyne by lyklihed sin she nis nat bareyne. explicit secunda pars. incipit tercia pars. ther fil as it bifalleth tymes mo whan that this child had souked but a throwe  this markis in his herte longeth so to tempte his wyf hir sadnesse for to knowe that he ne mighte out of his herte throwe this merveillous desyr his wyf tassaye needless god woot he thoughte hir for taffraye.  he hadde assayed hir ynogh bifore  and fond hir ever good; what neded it hir for to tempte and alwey more and more? though som men preise it for a subtil wit but as for me i seye that yvel it sit  tassaye a wyf whan that it is no nede and putten her in anguish and in drede. for which this markis wroghte in this manere; he cam alone anight ther as she lay with sterne face and with ful trouble chere  and seyde thus grisild quod he that day  that i yow took out of your povre array and putte yow in estaat of heigh noblesse ye have nat that forgeten as i gesse. i seye grisild this present dignitee  in which that i have put yow as i trowe maketh yow nat foryetful for to be that i yow took in povre estaat ful lowe for any wele ye moot yourselven knowe. tak hede of every word that i yow seye  ther is no wight that hereth it but we tweye.  ye woot yourself wel how that ye cam here into this hous it is nat longe ago and though to me that ye be lief and dere unto my gentils ye be nothing so;  they seyn to hem it is greet shame and wo for to be subgets and ben in servage to thee that born art of a smal village. and namely sith thy doghter was ybore thise wordes han they spoken doutelees;  but i desyre as i have doon bifore  to live my lyf with hem in reste and pees; i may nat in this caas be recchelees. i moot don with thy doghter for the beste nat as i wolde but as my peple leste.  and yet god wot this is ful looth to me; but nathelees withoute your witing i wol nat doon but this wol i quod he that ye to me assente as in this thing. shewe now your pacience in your werking  that ye me highte and swore in your village  that day that maked was our mariage. whan she had herd al this she noght ameved neither in word or chere or countenaunce; for as it semed she was nat agreved:  she seyde lord al lyth in your plesaunce my child and i with hertly obeisaunce ben youres al and ye mowe save or spille your owene thing; werketh after your wille. ther may nothing god so my soule save  lyken to yow that may displese me;  ne i desyre nothing for to have ne drede for to lese save only ye; this wil is in myn herte and ay shal be. no lengthe of tyme or deeth may this deface  ne chaunge my corage to another place. glad was this markis of hir answering but yet he feyned as he were nat so; al drery was his chere and his loking whan that he sholde out of the chambre go.  sone after this a furlong wey or two  he prively hath told al his entente unto a man and to his wyf him sente. a maner sergeant was this privee man the which that feithful ofte he founden hadde  in thinges grete and eek swich folk wel can don execucioun on thinges badde. the lord knew wel that he him loved and dradde; and whan this sergeant wiste his lordes wille into the chambre he stalked him ful stille.  madame he seyde ye mote foryeve it me  thogh i do thing to which i am constreyned; ye ben so wys that ful wel knowe ye that lordes hestes mowe nat been yfeyned; they mowe wel been biwailled or compleyned  but men mot nede unto her lust obeye and so wol i; ther is namore to seye. this child i am comanded for to take and spak namore but out the child he hente despitously and gan a chere make  as though he wolde han slayn it er he wente.  grisildis mot al suffren and consente; and as a lamb she sitteth meke and stille and leet this cruel sergeant doon his wille. suspecious was the diffame of this man  suspect his face suspect his word also; suspect the tyme in which he this bigan. allas! hir doghter that she lovede so she wende he wolde han slawen it right tho. but natheles she neither weep ne syked  consenting hir to that the markis lyked.  but atte laste speken she bigan and mekely she to the sergeant preyde so as he was a worthy gentil man that she moste kisse hir child er that it deyde;  and in her barm this litel child she leyde with ful sad face and gan the child to kisse and lulled it and after gan it blisse. and thus she seyde in hir benigne voys far weel my child; i shal thee never see;  but sith i thee have marked with the croys  of thilke fader blessed mote thou be that for us deyde upon a croys of tree. thy soule litel child i him bitake for this night shaltow dyen for my sake.  i trowe that to a norice in this cas it had ben hard this rewthe for to se; wel mighte a mooder than han cryed allas! but nathelees so sad stedfast was she that she endured all adversitee  and to the sergeant mekely she sayde  have heer agayn your litel yonge mayde. goth now quod she and dooth my lordes heste but o thing wol i preye yow of your grace that but my lord forbad yow atte leste  burieth this litel body in som place that bestes ne no briddes it torace. but he no word wol to that purpos seye but took the child and wente upon his weye. this sergeant cam unto his lord ageyn  and of grisildis wordes and hir chere  he tolde him point for point in short and playn and him presenteth with his doghter dere. somwhat this lord hath rewthe in his manere; but nathelees his purpos heeld he stille  as lordes doon whan they wol han hir wille; and bad his sergeant that he prively sholde this child ful softe winde and wrappe with alle circumstances tendrely and carie it in a cofre or in a lappe;  but upon peyne his heed of for to swappe  that no man sholde knowe of his entente ne whenne he cam ne whider that he wente; but at boloigne to his suster dere that thilke tyme of panik was countesse  he sholde it take and shewe hir this matere bisekinge hir to don hir bisinesse this child to fostre in alle gentilesse; and whos child that it was he bad hir hyde from every wight for oght that may bityde.  the sergeant gooth and hath fulfild this thing;  but to this markis now retourne we; for now goth he ful faste imagining if by his wyves chere he mighte see or by hir word aperceyve that she  were chaunged; but he never hir coude finde but ever in oon ylyke sad and kinde. as glad as humble as bisy in servyse and eek in love as she was wont to be was she to him in every maner wyse;  ne of hir doghter noght a word spak she.  non accident for noon adversitee was seyn in hir ne never hir doghter name ne nempned she in ernest nor in game. explicit tercia pars. sequitur pars quarta. in this estaat ther passed been foure yeer  er she with childe was; but as god wolde a knave child she bar by this walter ful gracious and fair for to biholde. and whan that folk it to his fader tolde nat only he but al his contree merie  was for this child and god they thanke and herie.  whan it was two yeer old and fro the brest departed of his norice on a day this markis caughte yet another lest to tempte his wyf yet ofter if he may.  o needles was she tempted in assay! but wedded men ne knowe no mesure whan that they finde a pacient creature. wyf quod this markis ye han herd er this my peple sikly berth our mariage  and namely sith my sone yboren is  now is it worse than ever in al our age. the murmur sleeth myn herte and my corage; for to myne eres comth the voys so smerte that it wel ny destroyed hath myn herte.  now sey they thus whan walter is agoon then shal the blood of ianicle succede and been our lord for other have we noon; swiche wordes seith my peple out of drede. wel oughte i of swich murmur taken hede;  for certeinly i drede swich sentence  though they nat pleyn speke in myn audience. i wolde live in pees if that i mighte; wherfor i am disposed outerly as i his suster servede by nighte  right so thenke i to serve him prively; this warne i yow that ye nat sodeynly out of yourself for no wo sholde outraye; beth pacient and therof i yow preye. i have quod she seyd thus and ever shal  i wol no thing ne nil no thing certayn  but as yow list; noght greveth me at al thogh that my doghter and my sone be slayn at your comandement this is to sayn. i have noght had no part of children tweyne  but first siknesse and after wo and peyne. ye been our lord doth with your owene thing right as yow list; axeth no reed at me. for as i lefte at hoom al my clothing whan i first cam to yow right so quod she  left i my wil and al my libertee  and took your clothing; wherfor i yow preye doth your plesaunce i wol your lust obeye. and certes if i hadde prescience your wil to knowe er ye your lust me tolde  i wolde it doon withouten necligence; but now i woot your lust and what ye wolde al your plesaunce ferme and stable i holde; for wiste i that my deeth wolde do yow ese right gladly wolde i dyen yow to plese.  deth may noght make no comparisoun  unto your love: and whan this markis sey the constance of his wyf he caste adoun his yen two and wondreth that she may in pacience suffre al this array.  and forth he gooth with drery contenaunce but to his herte it was ful greet plesaunce. this ugly sergeant in the same wyse that he hir doghter caughte right so he or worse if men worse can devyse  hath hent hir sone that ful was of beautee.  and ever in oon so pacient was she that she no chere made of hevinesse but kiste hir sone and after gan it blesse; save this; she preyed him that if he mighte  hir litel sone he wolde in erthe grave his tendre limes delicat to sighte fro foules and fro bestes for to save. but she non answer of him mighte have. he wente his wey as him nothing ne roghte;  but to boloigne he tendrely it broghte.  this markis wondreth ever lenger the more upon hir pacience and if that he ne hadde soothly knowen therbifore that parfitly hir children lovede she  he wolde have wend that of som subtiltee and of malice or for cruel corage that she had suffred this with sad visage. but wel he knew that next himself certayn she loved hir children best in every wyse.  but now of wommen wolde i axen fayn  if thise assayes mighte nat suffyse? what coude a sturdy housbond more devyse to preve hir wyfhod and hir stedfastnesse and he continuing ever in sturdinesse?  but ther ben folk of swich condicioun that whan they have a certein purpos take they can nat stinte of hir entencioun but right as they were bounden to a stake they wol nat of that firste purpos slake.  right so this markis fulliche hath purposed  to tempte his wyf as he was first disposed. he waiteth if by word or contenance that she to him was changed of corage; but never coude he finde variance;  she was ay oon in herte and in visage; and ay the forther that she was in age the more trewe if that it were possible she was to him in love and more penible. for which it semed thus that of hem two  ther nas but o wil; for as walter leste  the same lust was hir plesance also and god be thanked al fil for the beste. she shewed wel for no worldly unreste a wyf as of hirself nothing ne sholde  wille in effect but as hir housbond wolde. the sclaundre of walter ofte and wyde spradde that of a cruel herte he wikkedly for he a povre womman wedded hadde hath mordred bothe his children prively.  swich murmur was among hem comunly.  no wonder is for to the peples ere ther cam no word but that they mordred were. for which wheras his peple therbifore had loved him wel the sclaundre of his diffame  made hem that they him hatede therfore; to been a mordrer is an hateful name. but natheles for ernest ne for game he of his cruel purpos nolde stente; to tempte his wyf was set al his entente.  whan that his doghter twelf yeer was of age  he to the court of rome in subtil wyse enformed of his wil sente his message comaunding hem swiche bulles to devyse as to his cruel purpos may suffyse  how that the pope as for his peples reste bad him to wedde another if him leste. i seye he bad they sholde countrefete the popes bulles making mencioun that he hath leve his firste wyf to lete  as by the popes dispensacioun  to stinte rancour and dissencioun bitwixe his peple and him; thus seyde the bulle the which they han publiced atte fulle. the rude peple as it no wonder is  wenden ful wel that it had been right so; but whan thise tydinges cam to grisildis i deme that hir herte was ful wo. but she ylyke sad for evermo disposed was this humble creature  thadversitee of fortune al tendure.  abyding ever his lust and his plesaunce to whom that she was yeven herte and al as to hir verray worldly suffisaunce; but shortly if this storie i tellen shal  this markis writen hath in special a lettre in which he sheweth his entente and secrely he to boloigne it sente. to the erl of panik which that hadde tho wedded his suster preyde he specially  to bringen boom agayn his children two  in honurable estaat al openly. but o thing he him preyede outerly that he to no wight though men wolde enquere sholde nat telle whos children that they were  but seye the mayden sholde ywedded be unto the markis of saluce anon. and as this erl was preyed so dide he; for at day set he on his wey is goon toward saluce and lordes many oon  in riche array this mayden for to gyde;  hir yonge brother ryding hir bisyde. arrayed was toward hir mariage this fresshe mayde ful of gemmes clere; hir brother which that seven yeer was of age  arrayed eek ful fresh in his manere. and thus in greet noblesse and with glad chere toward saluces shaping hir iourney fro day to day they ryden in hir wey. explicit quarta pars. sequitur quinta pars. among al this after his wikke usage  this markis yet his wyf to tempte more  to the uttereste preve of hir corage fully to han experience and lore if that she were as stedfast as bifore he on a day in open audience  ful boistously hath seyd hir this sentence: certes grisilde i hadde ynough plesaunce to han yow to my wyf for your goodnesse as for your trouthe and for your obeisaunce nought for your linage ne for your richesse;  but now knowe i in verray soothfastnesse  that in gret lordshipe if i wel avyse ther is gret servitute in sondry wyse. i may nat don as every plowman may; my peple me constreyneth for to take  another wyf and cryen day by day; and eek the pope rancour for to slake consenteth it that dar i undertake; and treweliche thus muche i wol yow seye my newe wyf is coming by the weye.  be strong of herte and voyde anon hir place  and thilke dower that ye broghten me tak it agayn i graunte it of my grace; retourneth to your fadres hous quod he; no man may alwey han prosperitee;  with evene herte i rede yow tendure the strook of fortune or of aventure. and she answerde agayn in pacience my lord quod she i woot and wiste alway how that bitwixen your magnificence  and my poverte no wight can ne may  maken comparison; it is no nay. i ne heeld me never digne in no manere to be your wyf no ne your chamberere. and in this hous ther ye me lady made  the heighe god take i for my witnesse and also wisly he my soule glade i never heeld me lady ne maistresse but humble servant to your worthinesse and ever shal whyl that my lyf may dure  aboven every worldly creature.  that ye so longe of your benignitee han holden me in honour and nobleye wheras i was noght worthy for to be that thonke i god and yow to whom i preye  foryelde it yow; there is namore to seye. unto my fader gladly wol i wende and with him dwelle unto my lyves ende. ther i was fostred of a child ful smal til i be deed my lyf ther wol i lede  a widwe clene in body herte and al.  for sith i yaf to yow my maydenhede and am your trewe wyf it is no drede god shilde swich a lordes wyf to take another man to housbonde or to make.  and of your newe wyf god of his grace so graunte yow wele and prosperitee: for i wol gladly yelden hir my place in which that i was blisful wont to be for sith it lyketh yow my lord quod she  that whylom weren al myn hertes reste  that i shal goon i wol gon whan yow leste. but theras ye me profre swich dowaire as i first broghte it is wel in my minde it were my wrecched clothes nothing faire  the which to me were hard now for to finde. o gode god! how gentil and how kinde ye semed by your speche and your visage the day that maked was our mariage! but sooth is seyd algate i finde it trewe  for in effect it preved is on me  love is noght old as whan that it is newe. but certes lord for noon adversitee to dyen in the cas it shal nat be that ever in word or werk i shal repente  that i yow yaf myn herte in hool entente. my lord ye woot that in my fadres place ye dede me strepe out of my povre wede and richely me cladden of your grace. to yow broghte i noght elles out of drede  but feyth and nakednesse and maydenhede.  and here agayn my clothing i restore and eek my weddingring for evermore. the remenant of your iewels redy be inwith your chambre dar i saufly sayn;  naked out of my fadres hous quod she i cam and naked moot i turne agayn. al your plesaunce wol i folwen fayn; but yet i hope it be nat your entente that i smoklees out of your paleys wente.  ye coude nat doon so dishoneste a thing  that thilke wombe in which your children leye sholde biforn the peple in my walking be seyn al bare; wherfor i yow preye lat me nat lyk a worm go by the weye.  remembre yow myn owene lord so dere i was your wyf thogh i unworthy were. wherfor in guerdon of my maydenhede which that i broghte and noght agayn i bere as voucheth sauf to yeve me to my mede  but swich a smok as i was wont to were  that i therwith may wrye the wombe of here that was your wyf; and heer take i my leve of yow myn owene lord lest i yow greve. the smok quod he that thou hast on thy bak  lat it be stille and ber it forth with thee. but wel unnethes thilke word he spak but wente his wey for rewthe and for pitee. biforn the folk hirselven strepeth she and in hir smok with heed and foot al bare  toward hir fader hous forth is she fare.  the folk hir folwe wepinge in hir weye and fortune ay they cursen as they goon; but she fro weping kepte hir yen dreye ne in this tyme word ne spak she noon.  hir fader that this tyding herde anoon curseth the day and tyme that nature shoop him to been a lyves creature. for out of doute this olde povre man was ever in suspect of hir mariage;  for ever he demed sith that it bigan  that whan the lord fulfild had his corage him wolde thinke it were a disparage to his estaat so lowe for talighte and voyden hir as sone as ever he mighte.  agayns his doghter hastilich goth he for he by noyse of folk knew hir cominge and with hir olde cote as it mighte be he covered hir ful sorwefully wepinge; but on hir body mighte he it nat bringe.  for rude was the cloth and more of age  by dayes fele than at hir mariage. thus with hir fader for a certeyn space dwelleth this flour of wyfly pacience that neither by hir wordes ne hir face  biforn the folk ne eek in hir absence ne shewed she that hir was doon offence; ne of hir heigh estaat no remembraunce ne hadde she as by hir countenaunce. no wonder is for in hir grete estaat  hir goost was ever in pleyn humylitee;  no tendre mouth non herte delicaat no pompe no semblant of royaltee but ful of pacient benignitee discreet and prydeles ay honurable  and to hir housbonde ever meke and stable. men speke of iob and most for his humblesse as clerkes whan hem list can wel endyte namely of men but as in soothfastnesse thogh clerkes preyse wommen but a lyte  ther can no man in humblesse him acquyte  as womman can ne can ben half so trewe as wommen been but it be falle ofnewe. pars sexta. fro boloigne is this erl of panik come of which the fame upsprang to more and lesse  and in the peples eres alle and some was couth eek that a newe markisesse he with him broghte in swich pompe and richesse that never was ther seyn with mannes ye so noble array in al west lumbardye.  the markis which that shoop and knew al this  er that this erl was come sente his message for thilke sely povre grisildis; and she with humble herte and glad visage nat with no swollen thoght in hir corage  cam at his heste and on hir knees hir sette and reverently and wysly she him grette. grisild quod he my wille is outerly this mayden that shal wedded been to me receyved be tomorwe as royally  as it possible is in myn hous to be.  and eek that every wight in his degree have his estaat in sitting and servyse and heigh plesaunce as i can best devyse. i have no wommen suffisaunt certayn  the chambres for tarraye in ordinaunce after my lust and therfor wolde i fayn that thyn were al swich maner governaunce; thou knowest eek of old al my plesaunce; though thyn array be badde and yvel biseye  do thou thy devoir at the leeste weye.  nat only lord that i am glad quod she to doon your lust but i desyre also yow for to serve and plese in my degree withouten feynting and shal evermo.  ne never for no wele ne no wo ne shal the gost within myn herte stente to love yow best with al my trewe entente. and with that word she gan the hous to dighte and tables for to sette and beddes make;  and peyned hir to doon al that she mighte  preying the chambereres for goddes sake to hasten hem and faste swepe and shake; and she the moste servisable of alle hath every chambre arrayed and his halle.  abouten undern gan this erl alighte that with him broghte thise noble children tweye for which the peple ran to seen the sighte of hir array so richely biseye; and than at erst amonges hem they seye  that walter was no fool thogh that him leste  to chaunge his wyf for it was for the beste. for she is fairer as they demen alle than is grisild and more tendre of age and fairer fruit bitwene hem sholde falle  and more plesant for hir heigh linage; hir brother eek so fair was of visage that hem to seen the peple hath caught plesaunce commending now the markis governaunce. auctor. o stormy peple! unsad and ever untrewe!  ay undiscreet and chaunging as a vane  delyting ever in rumbel that is newe for lyk the mone ay wexe ye and wane; ay ful of clapping dere ynogh a iane; your doom is fals your constance yvel preveth  a ful greet fool is he that on yow leveth! thus seyden sadde folk in that citee whan that the peple gazed up and doun for they were glad right for the noveltee to han a newe lady of hir toun.  namore of this make i now mencioun;  but to grisilde agayn wol i me dresse and telle hir constance and hir bisinesse. ful bisy was grisilde in every thing that to the feste was apertinent;  right noght was she abayst of hir clothing though it were rude and somdel eek torent. but with glad chere to the yate is went with other folk to grete the markisesse and after that doth forth hir bisinesse.  with so glad chere his gestes she receyveth  and conningly everich in his degree that no defaute no man aperceyveth; but ay they wondren what she mighte be that in so povre array was for to see  and coude swich honour and reverence; and worthily they preisen hir prudence. in al this mene whyle she ne stente this mayde and eek hir brother to commende with al hir herte in ful benigne entente  so wel that no man coude hir prys amende.  but atte laste whan that thise lordes wende to sitten doun to mete he gan to calle grisilde as she was bisy in his halle. grisilde quod he as it were in his pley  how lyketh thee my wyf and hir beautee? right wel quod she my lord; for in good fey a fairer say i never noon than she. i prey to god yeve hir prosperitee; and so hope i that he wol to yow sende  plesance ynogh unto your lyves ende.  o thing biseke i yow and warne also that ye ne prikke with no tormentinge this tendre mayden as ye han don mo; for she is fostred in hir norishinge  more tendrely and to my supposinge she coude nat adversitee endure as coude a povre fostred creature. and whan this walter say hir pacience hir glade chere and no malice at al  and he so ofte had doon to hir offence  and she ay sad and constant as a wal continuing ever hir innocence overal this sturdy markis gan his herte dresse to rewen upon hir wyfly stedfastnesse.  this is ynogh grisilde myn quod he be now namore agast ne yvel apayed; i have thy feith and thy benignitee as wel as ever womman was assayed in greet estaat and povreliche arrayed.  now knowe i dere wyf thy stedfastnesse  and hir in armes took and gan hir kesse. and she for wonder took of it no keep; she herde nat what thing he to hir seyde; she ferde as she had stert out of a sleep  til she out of hir masednesse abreyde. grisilde quod he by god that for us deyde thou art my wyf ne noon other i have ne never hadde as god my soule save! this is thy doghter which thou hast supposed  to be my wyf; that other feithfully  shal be myn heir as i have ay purposed; thou bare him in thy body trewely. at boloigne have i kept hem prively; tak hem agayn for now maystow nat seye  that thou hast lorn non of thy children tweye. and folk that otherweyes han seyd of me i warne hem wel that i have doon this dede for no malice ne for no crueltee but for tassaye in thee thy wommanhede  and nat to sleen my children god forbede!  but for to kepe hem prively and stille til i thy purpos knewe and al thy wille. whan she this herde aswowne doun she falleth for pitous ioye and after hir swowninge  she bothe hir yonge children unto hir calleth and in hir armes pitously wepinge embraceth hem and tendrely kissinge ful lyk a mooder with hir salte teres she batheth bothe hir visage and hir heres.  o which a pitous thing it was to see  hir swowning and hir humble voys to here! grauntmercy lord that thanke i yow quod she that ye han saved me my children dere! now rekke i never to ben deed right here;  sith i stonde in your love and in your grace no fors of deeth ne whan my spirit pace! o tendre o dere o yonge children myne your woful mooder wende stedfastly that cruel houndes or som foul vermyne  hadde eten yow; but god of his mercy  and your benigne fader tendrely hath doon yow kept; and in that same stounde al sodeynly she swapte adoun to grounde. and in her swough so sadly holdeth she  hir children two whan she gan hem tembrace that with greet sleighte and greet difficultee the children from hir arm they gonne arace. o many a teer on many a pitous face doun ran of hem that stoden hir bisyde;  unnethe abouten hir mighte they abyde.  walter hir gladeth and hir sorwe slaketh; she ryseth up abaysed from hir traunce and every wight hir ioye and feste maketh til she hath caught agayn hir contenaunce.  walter hir dooth so feithfully plesaunce that it was deyntee for to seen the chere bitwixe hem two now they ben met yfere. thise ladyes whan that they hir tyme say han taken hir and into chambre goon  and strepen hir out of hir rude array  and in a cloth of gold that brighte shoon with a coroune of many a riche stoon upon hir heed they into halle hir broghte and ther she was honoured as hir oghte.  thus hath this pitous day a blisful ende for every man and womman dooth his might this day in murthe and revel to dispende til on the welkne shoon the sterres light. for more solempne in every mannes sight  this feste was and gretter of costage  than was the revel of hir mariage. ful many a yeer in heigh prosperitee liven thise two in concord and in reste and richely his doghter maried he  unto a lord oon of the worthieste of al itaille; and than in pees and reste his wyves fader in his court he kepeth til that the soule out of his body crepeth. his sone succedeth in his heritage  in reste and pees after his fader day;  and fortunat was eek in mariage al putte he nat his wyf in greet assay. this world is nat so strong it is no nay as it hath been in olde tymes yore  and herkneth what this auctour seith therfore. this storie is seyd nat for that wyves sholde folwen grisilde as in humilitee for it were importable though they wolde; but for that every wight in his degree  sholde be constant in adversitee  as was grisilde; therfor petrark wryteth this storie which with heigh style he endyteth. for sith a womman was so pacient unto a mortal man wel more us oghte  receyven al in gree that god us sent; for greet skile is he preve that he wroghte. but he ne tempteth no man that he boghte as seith seint iame if ye his pistel rede; he preveth folk al day it is no drede  and suffreth us as for our excercyse  with sharpe scourges of adversitee ful ofte to be bete in sondry wyse; nat for to knowe our wil for certes he er we were bom knew al our freletee;  and for our beste is al his governaunce; lat us than live in vertuous suffraunce. but o word lordinges herkneth er i go: it were ful hard to finde now a dayes in al a toun grisildes three or two;  for if that they were put to swiche assayes  the gold of hem hath now so badde alayes with bras that thogh the coyne be fair at ye it wolde rather breste atwo than plye. for which heer for the wyves love of bathe  whos lyf and al hir secte god mayntene in heigh maistrye and elles were it scathe i wol with lusty herte fresshe and grene seyn yow a song to glade yow i wene and lat us stinte of ernestful matere:  herkneth my song that seith in this manere.  lenvoy de chaucer. grisilde is deed and eek hir pacience and bothe atones buried in itaille; for which i crye in open audience no wedded man so hardy be tassaille  his wyves pacience in hope to finde grisildes for in certein he shall faille! o noble wyves ful of heigh prudence lat noon humilitee your tonge naille ne lat no clerk have cause or diligence  to wryte of yow a storie of swich mervaille  as of grisildis pacient and kinde; lest chichevache yow swelwe in hir entraille! folweth ekko that holdeth no silence but evere answereth at the countretaille;  beth nat bidaffed for your innocence but sharply tak on yow the governaille. emprinteth wel this lesson in your minde for commune profit sith it may availle. ye archewyves stondeth at defence  sin ye be stronge as is a greet camaille;  ne suffreth nat that men yow doon offence. and sclendre wyves feble as in bataille beth egre as is a tygre yond in inde; ay clappeth as a mille i yow consaille.  ne dreed hem nat do hem no reverence; for though thyn housbonde armed be in maille the arwes of thy crabbed eloquence shal perce his brest and eek his aventaille; in ialousye i rede eek thou him binde  and thou shalt make him couche as dooth a quaille. if thou be fair ther folk ben in presence shew thou thy visage and thyn apparaille; if thou be foul be free of thy dispence to gete thee freendes ay do thy travaille;  be ay of chere as light as leef on linde and lat him care and wepe and wringe and waille! here endeth the clerk of oxonford his tale. the prologe of the marchantes tale. weping and wayling care and other sorwe i know ynogh on even and amorwe quod the marchaunt and so don othere mo  that wedded been i trowe that it be so. for wel i woot it fareth so with me. i have a wyf the worste that may be; for thogh the feend to hir ycoupled were she wolde him overmacche i dar wel swere.  what sholde i yow reherce in special hir hye malice? she is a shrewe at al.  ther is a long and large difference bitwix grisildis grete pacience and of my wyf the passing crueltee.  were i unbounden also moot i thee! i wolde never eft comen in the snare. we wedded men live in sorwe and care; assaye whoso wol and he shal finde i seye sooth by seint thomas of inde  as for the more part i sey nat alle. god shilde that it sholde so bifalle!  a! good sir hoost! i have ywedded be thise monthes two and more nat pardee; and yet i trowe he that all his lyve  wyflees hath been though that men wolde him ryve unto the herte ne coude in no manere tellen so muchel sorwe as i now here coude tellen of my wyves cursednesse! now quod our hoost marchaunt so god yow blesse  sin ye so muchel knowen of that art ful hertely i pray yow telle us part.  gladly quod he but of myn owene sore for sory herte i telle may namore. here biginneth the marchantes tale. whylom ther was dwellinge in lumbardye  a worthy knight that born was of pavye in which he lived in greet prosperitee; and sixty yeer a wyflees man was he and folwed ay his bodily delyt on wommen theras was his appetyt  as doon thise foles that ben seculeer. and whan that he was passed sixty yeer were it for holinesse or for dotage i can nat seye but swich a greet corage  hadde this knight to been a wedded man  that day and night he dooth al that he can tespyen where he mighte wedded be; preyinge our lord to granten him that he mighte ones knowe of thilke blisful lyf that is bitwixe an housbond and his wyf;  and for to live under that holy bond with which that first god man and womman bond non other lyf seyde he is worth a bene; for wedlok is so esy and so clene  that in this world it is a paradys.  thus seyde this olde knight that was so wys. and certeinly as sooth as god is king to take a wyf it is a glorious thing and namely whan a man is old and hoor; thanne is a wyf the fruit of his tresor.  than sholde he take a yong wyf and a feir on which he mighte engendren him an heir and lede his lyf in ioye and in solas wheras thise bacheleres singe allas  whan that they finden any adversitee  in love which nis but childish vanitee. and trewely it sit wel to be so that bacheleres have often peyne and wo; on brotel ground they builde and brotelnesse they finde whan they wene sikernesse.  they live but as a brid or as a beste in libertee and under non areste theras a wedded man in his estaat liveth a lyf blisful and ordinaat  under the yok of mariage ybounde;  wel may his herte in ioye and blisse habounde. for who can be so buxom as a wyf? who is so trewe and eek so ententyf to kepe him syk and hool as is his make? for wele or wo she wol him nat forsake.  she nis nat wery him to love and serve thogh that he lye bedrede til he sterve. and yet somme clerkes seyn it nis nat so of whiche he theofraste is oon of tho.  what force though theofraste liste lye?  ne take no wyf quod he for housbondrye as for to spare in houshold thy dispence; a trewe servant dooth more diligence thy good to kepe than thyn owene wyf. for she wol clayme half part al hir lyf;  and if that thou be syk so god me save thy verray frendes or a trewe knave wol kepe thee bet than she that waiteth ay after thy good and hath don many a day.  and if thou take a wyf unto thyn hold t. om. ful lightly maystow been a cokewold. t. om. this sentence and an hundred thinges worse wryteth this man ther god his bones corse! but take no kepe of al swich vanitee; deffye theofraste and herke me.  a wyf is goddes yifte verraily; alle other maner yiftes hardily as londes rentes pasture or commune or moebles alle ben yiftes of fortune  that passen as a shadwe upon a wal.  but dredelees if pleynly speke i shal a wyf wol laste and in thyn hous endure wel lenger than thee list paraventure. mariage is a ful gret sacrement; he which that hath no wyf i holde him shent;  he liveth helplees and al desolat i speke of folk in seculer estaat. and herke why i sey nat this for noght that womman is for mannes help ywroght.  the hye god whan he hadde adam maked  and saugh him al allone belynaked god of his grete goodnesse seyde than lat us now make an help unto this man lyk to himself; and thanne he made him eve. heer may ye se and heerby may ye preve  that wyf is mannes help and his confort his paradys terrestre and his disport. so buxom and so vertuous is she they moste nedes live in unitee.  o flesh they been and o flesh as i gesse  hath but on herte in wele and in distresse. a wyf! a! seinte marie benedicite! how mighte a man han any adversitee that hath a wyf? certes i can nat seye. the blisse which that is bitwixe hem tweye  ther may no tonge telle or herte thinke. if he be povre she helpeth him to swinke; she kepeth his good and wasteth never a deel; al that hir housbonde lust hir lyketh weel;  she seith not ones nay whan he seith ye.  do this seith he; al redy sir seith she. o blisful ordre of wedlok precious thou art so mery and eek so vertuous and so commended and appreved eek that every man that halt him worth a leek  upon his bare knees oghte al his lyf thanken his god that him hath sent a wyf; or elles preye to god him for to sende a wyf to laste unto his lyves ende.  for thanne his lyf is set in sikernesse;  he may nat be deceyved as i gesse so that he werke after his wyves reed; than may he boldly beren up his heed they been so trewe and therwithal so wyse; for which if thou wolt werken as the wyse  do alwey so as wommen wol thee rede. lo how that iacob as thise clerkes rede by good conseil of his moder rebekke bond the kides skin aboute his nekke;  thurgh which his fadres benisoun he wan.  lo iudith as the storie eek telle can by wys conseil she goddes peple kepte and slow him olofernus whyl he slepte. lo abigayl by good conseil how she saved hir housbond nabal whan that he  sholde han be slayn; and loke ester also by good conseil delivered out of wo the peple of god and made him mardochee of assuere enhaunced for to be.  ther nis nothing in gree superlatyf  as seith senek above an humble wyf. suffre thy wyves tonge as caton bit; she shal comande and thou shalt suffren it; and yet she wol obeye of curteisye. a wyf is keper of thyn housbondrye;  wel may the syke man biwaille and wepe theras ther nis no wyf the hous to kepe. i warne thee if wysly thou wolt wirche love wel thy wyf as crist loveth his chirche.  if thou lovest thyself thou lovest thy wyf;  no man hateth his flesh but in his lyf he fostreth it and therfore bidde i thee cherisse thy wyf or thou shalt never thee. housbond and wyf what so men iape or pleye of worldly folk holden the siker weye;  they been so knit ther may noon harm bityde; and namely upon the wyves syde. for which this ianuarie of whom i tolde considered hath in with his dayes olde  the lusty lyf the vertuous quiete  that is in mariage honyswete; and for his freendes on a day he sente to tellen hem theffect of his entente. with face sad his tale he hath hem told; he seyde freendes i am hoor and old  and almost god wot on my pittes brinke; upon my soule somwhat moste i thinke. i have my body folily despended; blessed be god that it shal been amended!  for i wol be certeyn a wedded man  and that anoon in al the haste i can unto som mayde fair and tendre of age. i prey yow shapeth for my mariage al sodeynly for i wol nat abyde; and i wol fonde tespyen on my syde  to whom i may be wedded hastily. but forasmuche as ye ben mo than i ye shullen rather swich a thing espyen than i and wher me best were to allyen.  but o thing warne i yow my freendes dere  i wol non old wyf han in no manere. she shal nat passe twenty yeer certayn; old fish and yong flesh wolde i have ful fayn. bet is quod he a pyk than a pikerel; and bet than old boef is the tendre veel.  i wol no womman thritty yeer of age it is but benestraw and greet forage. and eek thise olde widwes god it woot they conne so muchel craft on wades boot  so muchel broken harm whan that hem leste  that with hem sholde i never live in reste. for sondry scoles maken sotil clerkis;

i woot myselven best what i may do.  though i be hoor i fare as dooth a tree that blosmeth er that fruyt ywoxen be; a blosmy tree nis neither drye ne deed. i fele me nowher hoor but on myn heed;  myn herte and alle my limes been as grene  as laurer thurgh the yeer is for to sene. and sin that ye han herd al myn entente i prey yow to my wil ye wole assente. diverse men diversely him tolde of mariage manye ensamples olde.  somme blamed it somme preysed it certeyn; but atte laste shortly for to seyn as al day falleth altercacioun bitwixen freendes in disputisoun  ther fil a stryf bitwixe his bretheren two  of whiche that oon was cleped placebo iustinus soothly called was that other. placebo seyde o ianuarie brother ful litel nede had ye my lord so dere conseil to axe of any that is here;  but that ye been so ful of sapience that yow ne lyketh for your heighe prudence to weyven fro the word of salomon. this word seyde he unto us everichon:  wirk alle thing by conseil thus seyde he  and thanne shaltow nat repente thee. but though that salomon spak swich a word myn owene dere brother and my lord so wisly god my soule bringe at reste i hold your owene conseil is the beste.  for brother myn of me tak this motyf i have now been a courtman al my lyf. and god it woot though i unworthy be i have stonden in ful greet degree  abouten lordes of ful heigh estaat;  yet hadde i never with noon of hem debaat. i never hem contraried trewely; i woot wel that my lord can more than i. what that he seith i holde it ferme and stable; i seye the same or elles thing semblable.  a ful gret fool is any conseillour that serveth any lord of heigh honour that dar presume or elles thenken it that his conseil sholde passe his lordes wit.  nay lordes been no foles by my fay;  ye han yourselven shewed heer today so heigh sentence so holily and weel that i consente and conferme everydeel your wordes alle and your opinioun. by god ther nis no man in al this toun  nin al itaille that coude bet han sayd; crist halt him of this conseil wel apayd. and trewely it is an heigh corage of any man that stopen is in age  to take a yong wyf; by my fader kin  your herte hangeth on a ioly pin. doth now in this matere right as yow leste for finally i holde it for the beste. iustinus that ay stille sat and herde right in this wyse to placebo answerde:  now brother myn be pacient i preye sin ye han seyd and herkneth what i seye. senek among his othere wordes wyse seith that a man oghte him right wel avyse  to whom he yeveth his lond or his catel.  and sin i oghte avyse me right wel to whom i yeve my good awey fro me wel muchel more i oghte avysed be to whom i yeve my body;

but nathelees it oghte ynough suffise  with any wyf if so were that she hadde mo gode thewes than hir vyces badde; and al this axeth leyser for tenquere. for god it woot i have wept many a tere  ful prively sin i have had a wyf.  preyse whoso wole a wedded mannes lyf certein i finde in it but cost and care and observances of alle blisses bare. and yet god woot my neighebores aboute and namely of wommen many a route  seyn that i have the moste stedefast wyf and eek the mekeste oon that bereth lyf. but i wot best wher wringeth me my sho. ye mowe for me right as yow lyketh do;

wyser men than thow as thou hast herd assenteden right now  to my purpos; placebo what sey ye? i seye it is a cursed man quod he that letteth matrimoine sikerly. and with that word they rysen sodeynly  and been assented fully that he sholde  be wedded whanne him list and wher he wolde. heigh fantasye and curious bisinesse fro day to day gan in the soule impresse of ianuarie aboute his mariage. many fair shap and many a fair visage  ther passeth thurgh his herte night by night. as whoso toke a mirour polished bright and sette it in a commune marketplace than sholde he see many a figure pace  by his mirour; and in the same wyse  gan ianuarie inwith his thoght devyse of maydens whiche that dwelten him bisyde. he wiste nat wher that he mighte abyde. for if that oon have beaute in hir face another stant so in the peples grace  for hir sadnesse and hir benignitee that of the peple grettest voys hath she. and somme were riche and hadden badde name. but nathelees bitwixe ernest and game  he atte laste apoynted him on oon  and leet alle othere from his herte goon and chees hir of his owene auctoritee; for love is blind al day and may nat see. and whan that he was in his bed ybroght he purtreyed in his herte and in his thoght  hir fresshe beautee and hir age tendre hir myddel smal hir armes longe and sclendre hir wyse governaunce hir gentillesse hir wommanly beringe and hir sadnesse.  and whan that he on hir was condescended  him thoughte his chois mighte nat ben amended. for whan that he himself concluded hadde him thoughte ech other mannes wit so badde that inpossible it were to replye agayn his chois this was his fantasye.  his freendes sente he to at his instaunce and preyed hem to doon him that plesaunce that hastily they wolden to him come; he wolde abregge hir labour alle and some.  nedeth namore for him to go ne ryde  he was apoynted ther he wolde abyde. placebo cam and eek his freendes sone and alderfirst he bad hem alle a bone that noon of hem none argumentes make agayn the purpos which that he hath take;  which purpos was plesant to god seyde he and verray ground of his prosperitee. he seyde ther was a mayden in the toun which that of beautee hadde greet renoun  al were it so she were of smal degree;  suffyseth him hir youthe and hir beautee. which mayde he seyde he wolde han to his wyf to lede in ese and holinesse his lyf. and thanked god that he mighte han hire al that no wight of his blisse parten shal.  and preyde hem to labouren in this nede and shapen that he faille nat to spede; for thanne he seyde his spirit was at ese. thanne is quod he nothing may me displese  save o thing priketh in my conscience  the which i wol reherce in your presence. i have quod he herd seyd ful yore ago ther may no man han parfite blisses two this is to seye in erthe and eek in hevene. for though he kepe him fro the sinnes sevene  and eek from every branche of thilke tree yet is ther so parfit felicitee and so greet ese and lust in mariage that ever i am agast now in myn age  that i shal lede now so mery a lyf  so delicat withouten wo and stryf that i shal have myn hevene in erthe here. for sith that verray hevene is boght so dere with tribulacioun and greet penaunce how sholde i thanne that live in swich plesaunce  as alle wedded men don with hir wyvis come to the blisse ther crist eterne on lyve is? this is my drede and ye my bretheren tweye assoilleth me this questioun i preye.  iustinus which that hated his folye  answerde anon right in his iaperye; and for he wolde his longe tale abregge he wolde noon auctoritee allegge but seyde sire so ther be noon obstacle other than this god of his hye miracle  and of his mercy may so for yow wirche that er ye have your right of holy chirche ye may repente of wedded mannes lyf in which ye seyn ther is no wo ne stryf.  and elles god forbede but he sente  a wedded man him grace to repente wel ofte rather than a sengle man! and therfore sire the beste reed i can dispeire yow noght but have in your memorie paraunter she may be your purgatorie!  she may be goddes mene and goddes whippe; than shal your soule up to hevene skippe swifter than dooth an arwe out of the bowe! i hope to god herafter shul ye knowe  that their nis no so greet felicitee  in mariage ne nevermo shal be that yow shal lette of your savacioun so that ye use as skile is and resoun the lustes of your wyf attemprely and that ye plese hir nat to amorously  and that ye kepe yow eek from other sinne. my tale is doon:for my wit is thinne. beth nat agast herof my brother dere. but lat us waden out of this matere.  the wyf of bathe if ye han understonde  of mariage which we have on honde declared hath ful wel in litel space. fareth now wel god have yow in his grace. and with this word this justin and his brother han take hir leve and ech of hem of other.  for whan they sawe it moste nedes be they wroghten so by sly and wys tretee that she this mayden which that maius highte as hastily as ever that she mighte  shal wedded be unto this ianuarie.  i trowe it were to longe yow to tarie if i yow tolde of every scrit and bond by which that she was feffed in his lond; or for to herknen of hir riche array. but finally ycomen is the day  that to the chirche bothe be they went for to receyve the holy sacrement. forth comth the preest with stole aboute his nekke and bad hir be lyk sarra and rebekke  in wisdom and in trouthe of mariage;  and seyde his orisons as is usage and crouched hem and bad god sholde hem blesse and made al siker ynogh with holinesse. thus been they wedded with solempnitee and at the feste sitteth he and she  with other worthy folk upon the deys. al ful of ioye and blisse is the paleys and ful of instruments and of vitaille the moste deyntevous of al itaille.  biforn hem stoode swiche instruments of soun  that orpheus ne of thebes amphioun ne maden never swich a melodye. at every cours than cam loud minstraleye that never tromped ioab for to here nor he theodomas yet half so clere  at thebes whan the citee was in doute. bacus the wyn hem skinketh al aboute and venus laugheth upon every wight. for ianuarie was bicome hir knight  and wolde bothe assayen his corage  in libertee and eek in mariage; and with hir fyrbrond in hir hand aboute daunceth biforn the bryde and al the route. and certeinly i dar right wel seyn this ymeneus that god of wedding is  saugh never his lyf so mery a wedded man. hold thou thy pees thou poete marcian that wrytest us that ilke wedding murie of hir philologye and him mercurie  and of the songes that the muses songe.  to smal is bothe thy penne and eek thy tonge for to descryven of this mariage. whan tendre youthe hath wedded stouping age ther is swich mirthe that it may nat be writen; assayeth it yourself than may ye witen  if that i lye or noon in this matere. maius that sit with so benigne a chere hir to biholde it semed fayerye; quene ester loked never with swich an ye  on assuer so meke a look hath she.  i may yow nat devyse al hir beautee; but thus muche of hir beautee telle i may that she was lyk the brighte morwe of may fulfild of alle beautee and plesaunce. this ianuarie is ravisshed in a traunce  at every time he loked on hir face; but in his herte he gan hir to manace that he that night in armes wolde hir streyne harder than ever paris dide eleyne.  but nathelees yet hadde he greet pitee  that thilke night offenden hir moste he; and thoughte allas! o tendre creature! now wolde god ye mighte wel endure al my corage it is so sharp and kene; i am agast ye shul it nat sustene.  but god forbede that i dide al my might! now wolde god that it were woxen night and that the night wolde lasten evermo. i wolde that al this peple were ago.  and finally he doth al his labour  as he best mighte savinge his honour to haste hem fro the mete in subtil wyse. the tyme cam that reson was to ryse; and after that men daunce and drinken faste and spyces al aboute the hous they caste;  and ful of ioye and blisse is every man; all but a squyer highte damian which carf biforn the knight ful many a day. he was so ravisshed on his lady may  that for the verray peyne he was ny wood;  almost he swelte and swowned ther he stood. so sore hath venus hurt him with hir brond as that she bar it daunsinge in hir hond. and to his bed he wente him hastily; namore of him as at this tyme speke i.  but ther i lete him wepe ynough and pleyne til fresshe may wol rewen on his peyne. o perilous fyr that in the bedstraw bredeth! auctor. o famulier foo that his servyce bedeth!  o servant traitour false hoomly hewe  lyk to the naddre in bosom sly untrewe god shilde us alle from your aqueyntaunce! o ianuarie dronken in plesaunce of mariage see how thy damian thyn owene squyer and thy borne man  entendeth for to do thee vileinye. god graunte thee thyn hoomly fo tespye. for in this world nis worse pestilence than hoomly foo al day in thy presence.  parfourned hath the sonne his ark diurne  no lenger may the body of him soiurne on thorisonte as in that latitude. night with his mantel that is derk and rude gan oversprede the hemisperie aboute; for which departed is this lusty route  fro ianuarie with thank on every syde. hom to hir houses lustily they ryde wheras they doon hir thinges as hem leste and whan they sye hir tyme goon to reste.  sone after that this hastif ianuarie  wolde go to bedde he wolde no lenger tarie. he drinketh ipocras clarree and vernage of spyces hote tencresen his corage; and many a letuarie hadde he ful fyn swiche as the cursed monk dan constantyn  hath writen in his book de coitu; to eten hem alle he nas nothing eschu. and to his privee freendes thus seyde he: for goddes love as sone as it may be  lat voyden al this hous in curteys wyse.  and they han doon right as he wol devyse. men drinken and the travers drawe anon; the bryde was broght abedde as stille as stoon; and whan the bed was with the preest yblessed out of the chambre hath every wight him dressed.  and ianuarie hath faste in armes take his fresshe may his paradys his make. he lulleth hir he kisseth hir ful ofte with thikke bristles of his berd unsofte  lyk to the skin of houndfish sharp as brere  for he was shave al newe in his manere. he rubbeth hir aboute hir tendre face and seyde thus allas! i moot trespace to yow my spouse and yow gretly offende er tyme come that i wil doun descende.  but nathelees considereth this quod he ther nis no werkman whatsoever he be that may bothe werke wel and hastily; this wol be doon at leyser parfitly.  it is no fors how longe that we pleye;  in trewe wedlok wedded be we tweye; and blessed be the yok that we been inne for in our actes we mowe do no sinne. a man may do no sinne with his wyf ne hurte himselven with his owene knyf;  for we han leve to pleye us by the lawe. thus laboureth he til that the day gan dawe; and than he taketh a sop in fyn clarree and upright in his bed than sitteth he  and after that he sang ful loude and clere  and kiste his wyf and made wantoun chere. he was al coltish ful of ragerye and ful of iargon as a flekked pye. the slakke skin aboute his nekke shaketh whyl that he sang; so chaunteth he and craketh.  but god wot what that may thoughte in hir herte whan she him saugh up sittinge in his sherte in his nightcappe and with his nekke lene; she preyseth nat his pleying worth a bene.  than seide he thus my reste wol i take;  now day is come i may no lenger wake. and doun he leyde his heed and sleep til pryme. and afterward whan that he saugh his tyme up ryseth ianuarie; but fresshe may holdeth hir chambre unto the fourthe day  as usage is of wyves for the beste. for every labour somtyme moot han reste or elles longe may he nat endure; this is to seyn no lyves creature  be it of fish or brid or beest or man.  now wol i speke of woful damian auctor. that languissheth for love as ye shul here; therfore i speke to him in this manere: i seye o sely damian allas! answere to my demaunde as in this cas  how shaltow to thy lady fresshe may telle thy wo? she wole alwey seye nay; eek if thou speke she wol thy wo biwreye; god be thyn help i can no bettre seye.  this syke damian in venus fyr  so brenneth that he dyeth for desyr; for which he putte his lyf in aventure no lenger mighte he in this wyse endure; but prively a penner gan he borwe and in a lettre wroot he al his sorwe  in manere of a compleynt or a lay unto his faire fresshe lady may. and in a purs of silk heng on his sherte he hath it put and leyde it at his herte.  the mone that at noon was thilke day  that ianuarie hath wedded fresshe may in two of taur was into cancre gliden; so longe hath maius in hir chambre biden as custume is unto thise nobles alle. a bryde shal nat eten in the halle  til dayes foure or three dayes atte leste ypassed been; than lat hir go to feste. the fourthe day compleet fro noon to noon whan that the heighe masse was ydoon  in halle sit this ianuarie and may  as fresh as is the brighte someres day. and so bifel how that this gode man remembred him upon this damian and seyde seinte marie! how may this be that damian entendeth nat to me?  is he ay syk or how may this bityde? his squyeres whiche that stoden ther bisyde excused him bycause of his siknesse which letted him to doon his bisinesse;  noon other cause mighte make him tarie.  that me forthinketh quod this ianuarie he is a gentil squyer by my trouthe! if that he deyde it were harm and routhe; he is as wys discreet and as secree as any man i woot of his degree;  and therto manly and eek servisable and for to been a thrifty man right able. but after mete as sone as ever i may i wol myself visyte him and eek may  to doon him al the confort that i can.  and for that word him blessed every man that of his bountee and his gentillesse he wolde so conforten in siknesse his squyer for it was a gentil dede. dame quod this ianuarie tak good hede  atafter mete ye with your wommen alle whan ye han been in chambre out of this halle that alle ye go see this damian; doth him disport he is a gentil man;  and telleth him that i wol him visyte  have i nothing but rested me a lyte; and spede yow faste for i wole abyde til that ye slepe faste by my syde. and with that word he gan to him to calle a squyer that was marchal of his halle  and tolde him certeyn thinges what he wolde. this fresshe may hath streight hir wey yholde with alle hir wommen unto damian. doun by his beddes syde sit she than  confortinge him as goodly as she may.  this damian whan that his tyme he say in secree wise his purs and eek his bille in which that he ywriten hadde his wille hath put into hir hand withouten more save that he syketh wonder depe and sore  and softely to hir right thus seyde he: mercy! and that ye nat discovere me; for i am deed if that this thing be kid. this purs hath she inwith hir bosom hid  and wente hir wey; ye gete namore of me.  but unto ianuarie ycomen is she that on his beddes syde sit ful softe. he taketh hir and kisseth hir ful ofte and leyde him doun to slepe and that anon. she feyned hir as that she moste gon  theras ye woot that every wight mot nede. and whan she of this bille hath taken hede she rente it al to cloutes atte laste and in the privee softely it caste.  who studieth now but faire fresshe may?  adoun by olde ianuarie she lay that sleep til that the coughe hath him awaked; anon he preyde hir strepen hir al naked; he wolde of hir he seyde han som plesaunce and seyde hir clothes dide him encombraunce  and she obeyeth be hir lief or looth. but lest that precious folk be with me wrooth how that he wroghte i dar nat to yow telle; or whether hir thoughte it paradys or helle;  but here i lete hem werken in hir wyse  til evensong rong and that they moste aryse. were it by destinee or aventure were it by influence or by nature or constellacion that in swich estat the hevene stood that tyme fortunat  was for to putte a bille of venus werkes for alle thing hath tyme as seyn thise clerkes to any womman for to gete hir love i can nat seye; but grete god above  that knoweth that non act is causelees  he deme of al for i wol holde my pees. but sooth is this how that this fresshe may hath take swich impression that day for pitee of this syke damian that from hir herte she ne dryve can  the remembraunce for to doon him ese. certeyn thoghte she whom that this thing displese i rekke noght for here i him assure to love him best of any creature  though he namore hadde than his sherte.  lo pitee renneth sone in gentil herte. heer may ye se how excellent franchyse in wommen is whan they hem narwe avyse. som tyrant is as ther be many oon that hath an herte as hard as any stoon  which wolde han lete him sterven in the place wel rather than han graunted him hir grace; and hem reioysen in hir cruel pryde and rekke nat to been an homicyde.  this gentil may fulfilled of pitee  right of hir hande a lettre made she in which she graunteth him hir verray grace; ther lakketh noght but only day and place wher that she mighte unto his lust suffyse: for it shal be right as he wol devyse.  and whan she saugh hir time upon a day to visite this damian goth may and sotilly this lettre doun she threste under his pilwe rede it if him leste.  she taketh him by the hand and harde him twiste  so secrely that no wight of it wiste and bad him been al hool and forth she wente to ianuarie whan that he for hir sente. up ryseth damian the nexte morwe al passed was his siknesse and his sorwe.  he kembeth him he proyneth him and pyketh he dooth al that his lady lust and lyketh; and eek to ianuarie he gooth as lowe as ever dide a dogge for the bowe.  he is so plesant unto every man  for craft is al whoso that do it can that every wight is fayn to speke him good; and fully in his lady grace he stood. thus lete i damian aboute his nede and in my tale forth i wol procede.  somme clerkes holden that felicitee stant in delyt and therefor certeyn he this noble ianuarie with al his might in honest wyse as longeth to a knight  shoop him to live ful deliciously.  his housinge his array as honestly to his degree was maked as a kinges. amonges othere of his honest thinges he made a gardin walled al with stoon; so fair a gardin woot i nowher noon.  for out of doute i verraily suppose that he that wroot the romance of the rose ne coude of it the beautee wel devyse; ne priapus ne mighte nat suffyse  though he be god of gardins for to telle  the beautee of the gardin and the welle that stood under a laurer alwey grene. ful ofte tyme he pluto and his quene proserpina and al hir fayerye disporten hem and maken melodye aboute that welle and daunced as men tolde. this noble knight this ianuarie the olde swich deintee hath in it to walke and pleye that he wol no wight suffren bere the keye  save he himself; for of the smale wiket  he bar alwey of silver a smal cliket with which whan that him leste he it unshette. and whan he wolde paye his wyf hir dette in somer seson thider wolde he go and may his wyf and no wight but they two; and thinges whiche that were nat doon abedde he in the gardin parfourned hem and spedde. and in this wyse many a mery day lived this ianuarie and fresshe may.  but worldly ioye may nat alwey dure  to ianuarie ne to no creature. o sodeyn hap o thou fortune instable auctor. lyk to the scorpioun so deceivable that flaterest with thyn heed when thou wolt stinge; thy tayl is deeth thurgh thyn enveniminge.  o brotil ioye! o swete venim queynte! o monstre that so subtilly canst peynte thy yiftes under hewe of stedfastnesse that thou deceyvest bothe more and lesse!  why hastow ianuarie thus deceyved  that haddest him for thy ful frend receyved? and now thou hast biraft him bothe hise yen for sorwe of which desyreth he to dyen. allas! this noble ianuarie free amidde his lust and his prosperitee  is woxen blind and that al sodeynly. he wepeth and he wayleth pitously; and therwithal the fyr of ialousye lest that his wyf sholde falle in som folye  so brente his herte that he wolde fayn  that som man bothe him and hir had slayn. for neither after his deeth nor in his lyf ne wolde he that she were love ne wyf but ever live as widwe in clothes blake soul as the turtle that lost hath hir make.  but atte laste after a monthe or tweye his sorwe gan aswage sooth to seye; for whan he wiste it may noon other be he paciently took his adversitee;  save out of doute he may nat forgoon  that he nas ialous evermore in oon; which ialousye it was so outrageous that neither in halle nin noon other hous ne in noon other place neverthemo he nolde suffre hir for to ryde or go  butif that he had hand on hir alway; for which ful ofte wepeth fresshe may that loveth damian so benignely that she mot outher dyen sodeynly  or elles she mot han him as hir leste;  she wayteth whan hir herte wolde breste. upon that other syde damian bicomen is the sorwefulleste man that ever was; for neither night ne day ne mighte he speke a word to fresshe may  as to his purpos of no swich matere butif that ianuarie moste it here that hadde an hand upon hir evermo. but nathelees by wryting to and fro  and privee signes wiste he what she mente;  and she knew eek the fyn of his entente. o ianuarie what mighte it thee availle auctor. thou mightest see as fer as shippes saille? for also good is blind deceyved be as be deceyved whan a man may se.  lo argus which that hadde an hondred yen for al that ever he coude poure or pryen yet was he blent; and god wot so ben mo that wenen wisly that it be nat so.  passe over is an ese i sey namore.  this fresshe may that i spak of so yore in warme wex hath emprented the cliket that ianuarie bar of the smale wiket by which into his gardin ofte he wente. and damian that knew al hir entente  the cliket countrefeted prively; ther nis namore to seye but hastily som wonder by this cliket shal bityde which ye shul heren if ye wole abyde.  o noble ovyde ful sooth seystou god woot! auctor. what sleighte is it thogh it be long and hoot  that he nil finde it out in som manere? by piramus and tesbee may men lere; thogh they were kept ful longe streite overal they been accorded rouninge thurgh a wal  ther no wight coude han founde out swich a sleighte. but now to purpos; er that dayes eighte were passed er the monthe of iuil bifil that ianuarie hath caught so greet a wil  thurgh egging of his wyf him for to pleye  in his gardin and no wight but they tweye that in a morwe unto this may seith he: rys up my wyf my love my lady free; the turtles vois is herd my douve swete; the winter is goon with alle his reynes wete;  com forth now with thyn eyen columbyn! how fairer been thy brestes than is wyn! the gardin is enclosed al aboute; com forth my whyte spouse; out of doute  thou hast me wounded in myn herte o wyf!  no spot of thee ne knew i al my lyf. com forth and lat us taken our disport; i chees thee for my wyf and my confort. swiche olde lewed wordes used he; on damian a signe made she  that he sholde go biforen with his cliket: this damian thanne hath opened the wiket and in he stirte and that in swich manere that no wight mighte it see neither yhere;  and stille he sit under a bush anoon.  this ianuarie as blind as is a stoon with maius in his hand and no wight mo into his fresshe gardin is ago and clapte to the wiket sodeynly. now wyf quod he heer nis but thou and i  that art the creature that i best love. for by that lord that sit in heven above lever ich hadde dyen on a knyf than thee offende trewe dere wyf!  for goddes sake thenk how i thee chees  noght for no coveityse doutelees but only for the love i had to thee. and though that i be old and may nat see beth to me trewe and i shal telle yow why. three thinges certes shul ye winne therby;

this is withouten doute. now kis me wyf and lat us rome aboute.  this fresshe may whan she thise wordes herde  benignely to ianuarie answerde but first and forward she bigan to wepe i have quod she a soule for to kepe as wel as ye and also myn honour and of my wyfhod thilke tendre flour  which that i have assured in your hond whan that the preest to yow my body bond; wherfore i wole answere in this manere by the leve of yow my lord so dere:  i prey to god that never dawe the day  that i ne sterve as foule as womman may if ever i do unto my kin that shame or elles i empeyre so my name that i be fals; and if i do that lakke do strepe me and put me in a sakke  and in the nexte river do me drenche. i am a gentil womman and no wenche. why speke ye thus? but men ben ever untrewe and wommen have repreve of yow ay newe.  ye han non other contenance i leve  but speke to us of untrust and repreve. and with that word she saugh wher damian sat in the bush and coughen she bigan and with hir finger signes made she that damian sholde climbe upon a tree  that charged was with fruit and up he wente; for verraily he knew al hir entente and every signe that she coude make wel bet than ianuarie hir owene make.  for in a lettre she had told him al  of this matere how he werchen shal. and thus i lete him sitte upon the pyrie and ianuarie and may rominge myrie. bright was the day and blew the firmament phebus of gold his stremes doun hath sent  to gladen every flour with his warmnesse. he was that tyme in geminis as i gesse but litel fro his declinacioun of cancer iovis exaltacioun.  and so bifel that brighte morwetyde  that in that gardin in the ferther syde pluto that is the king of fayerye and many a lady in his companye folwinge his wyf the quene proserpyne ech after other right as any lyne  whil that she gadered floures in the mede in claudian ye may the story rede how in his grisly carte he hir fette: this king of fairye thanne adoun him sette  upon a bench of turves fresh and grene  and right anon thus seyde he to his quene. my wyf quod he ther may no wight sey nay; thexperience so preveth every day the treson whiche that wommen doon to man. ten hondred thousand stories telle i can  notable of your untrouthe and brotilnesse. o salomon wys richest of richesse fulfild of sapience and of worldly glorie ful worthy been thy wordes to memorie  to every wight that wit and reson can.  thus preiseth he yet the bountee of man: amonges a thousand men yet fond i oon but of wommen alle fond i noon. thus seith the king that knoweth your wikkednesse; and iesus filius syrak as i gesse  ne speketh of yow but selde reverence. a wilde fyr and corrupt pestilence so falle upon your bodies yet tonight! ne see ye nat this honurable knight  bycause allas! that he is blind and old  his owene man shal make him cokewold; lo heer he sit the lechour in the tree. now wol i graunten of my magestee unto this olde blinde worthy knight that he shal have ayeyn his eyen sight  whan that his wyf wold doon him vileinye; than shal he knowen al hir harlotrye both in repreve of hir and othere mo. ye shal quod proserpyne wol ye so;  now by my modres sires soule i swere  that i shal yeven hir suffisant answere and alle wommen after for hir sake; that though they be in any gilt ytake with face bold they shulle hemself excuse and bere hem doun that wolden hem accuse.  for lakke of answer noon of hem shal dyen. al hadde man seyn a thing with bothe his yen yit shul we wommen visage it hardily and wepe and swere and chyde subtilly  so that ye men shul been as lewed as gees. what rekketh me of your auctoritees? i woot wel that this iew this salomon fond of us wommen foles many oon. but though that he ne fond no good womman yet hath ther founde many another man  wommen ful trewe ful gode and vertuous. witnesse on hem that dwelle in cristes hous with martirdom they preved hir constance. the romayn gestes maken remembrance  of many a verray trewe wyf also.  but sire ne be nat wrooth albeit so though that he seyde he fond no good womman i prey yow take the sentence of the man; he mente thus that in sovereyn bontee nis noon but god that sit in trinitee.  ey! for verray god that nis but oon what make ye so muche of salomon? what though he made a temple goddes hous? what though he were riche and glorious?  so made he eek a temple of false goddis  how mighte he do a thing that more forbode is? pardee as faire as ye his name emplastre he was a lechour and an ydolastre; and in his elde he verray god forsook. and if that god ne hadde as seith the book  yspared him for his fadres sake he sholde have lost his regne rather than he wolde. i sette noght of al the vileinye that ye of wommen wryte a boterflye.  i am a womman nedes moot i speke  or elles swelle til myn herte breke. for sithen he seyde that we ben iangleresses as ever hool i mote brouke my tresses i shal nat spare for no curteisye to speke him harm that wolde us vileinye.  dame quod this pluto be no lenger wrooth; i yeve it up; but sith i swoor myn ooth that i wolde graunten him his sighte ageyn my word shal stonde i warne yow certeyn.  i am a king it sit me noght to lye.  and i quod she a queene of fayerye. hir answere shal she have i undertake; lat us namore wordes heerof make. for sothe i wol no lenger yow contrarie. now lat us turne agayn to ianuarie  that in the gardin with his faire may singeth ful merier than the papeiay yow love i best and shal and other noon. so longe aboute the aleyes is he goon  til he was come agaynes thilke pyrie  wheras this damian sitteth fill myrie an heigh among the fresshe leves grene. this fresshe may that is so bright and shene gan for to syke and seyde allas my syde! now sir quod she for aught that may bityde  i moste han of the peres that i see or i mot dye so sore longeth me to eten of the smale peres grene. help for hir love that is of hevene quene!  i telle yow wel a womman in my plyt  may han to fruit so greet an appetyt that she may dyen but she of it have. allas! quod he that i ne had heer a knave that coude climbe;

up to the tree he caste his eyen two  and saugh that damian his wyf had dressed in swich manere it may nat ben expressed but if i wolde speke uncurteisly: and up he yaf a roring and a cry  as doth the moder whan the child shal dye:  out! help! allas! harrow! he gan to crye o stronge lady store what dostow? and she answerde sir what eyleth yow? have pacience and reson in your minde i have yow holpe on bothe your eyen blinde.  up peril of my soule i shal nat lyen as me was taught to hele with your yen was nothing bet to make yow to see than strugle with a man upon a tree.  god woot i dide it in ful good entente.  strugle! quod he ye algate in it wente! god yeve yow bothe on shames deeth to dyen! he swyved thee i saugh it with myne yen and elles be i hanged by the hals! thanne is quod she my medicyne al fals;

but sire a man that waketh out of his sleep he may nat sodeynly wel taken keep upon a thing ne seen it parfitly til that he be adawed verraily;  right so a man that longe hath blind ybe ne may nat sodeynly so wel ysee first whan his sighte is newe come ageyn as he that hath a day or two yseyn.  til that your sighte ysatled be a whyle  ther may ful many a sighte yow bigyle. beth war i prey yow; for by hevene king ful many a man weneth to seen a thing and it is al another than it semeth. he that misconceyveth he misdemeth.  and with that word she leep doun fro the tree. this ianuarie who is glad but he? he kisseth hir and clippeth hir ful ofte and on hir wombe he stroketh hir ful softe  and to his palays hoom he hath hir lad.  now gode men i pray yow to be glad. thus endeth heer my tale of ianuarie; god blesse us and his moder seinte marie! here is ended the marchantes tale of ianuarie. ey! goddes mercy! seyde our hoste tho now swich a wyf i pray god kepe me fro!  lo whiche sleightes and subtilitees in wommen been! for ay as bisy as bees ben they us sely men for to deceyve and from a sothe ever wol they weyve;

for certes ye connen theron as muche as any man. nay sir quod he but i wol seye as i can with hertly wille; for i wol nat rebelle  agayn your lust; a tale wol i telle. have me excused if i speke amis my wil is good; and lo my tale is this. here biginneth the squieres tale. at sarray in the land of tartarye  ther dwelte a king that werreyed russye  thurgh which ther deyde many a doughty man. this noble king was cleped cambinskan which in his tyme was of so greet renoun that ther nas nowher in no regioun so excellent a lord in alle thing;  him lakked noght that longeth to a king. as of the secte of which that he was born he kepte his lay to which that he was sworn;  and therto be was hardy wys and riche and pietous and iust alwey yliche  sooth of his word benigne and honurable of his corage as any centre stable; yong fresh and strong in armes desirous as any bacheler of al his hous. a fair persone he was and fortunat  and kepte alwey so wel royal estat that ther was nowher swich another man. this noble king this tartre cambinskan  hadde two sones on elpheta his wyf of whiche the eldeste highte algarsyf  that other sone was cleped cambalo. a doghter hadde this worthy king also that yongest was and highte canacee. but for to telle yow al hir beautee it lyth nat in my tonge nin my conning;  i dar nat undertake so heigh a thing. myn english eek is insufficient; it moste been a rethor excellent  that coude his colours longing for that art if he sholde hir discryven every part.  i am non swich i moot speke as i can. and so bifel that whan this cambinskan hath twenty winter born his diademe as he was wont fro yeer to yeer i deme he leet the feste of his nativitee  don cryen thurghout sarray his citee the last idus of march after the yeer. phebus the sonne ful iory was and cleer;  for he was neigh his exaltacioun in martes face and in his mansioun  in aries the colerik hote signe. ful lusty was the weder and benigne for which the foules agayn the sonne shene what for the seson and the yonge grene ful loude songen hir affecciouns;  him semed han geten hem protecciouns agayn the swerd of winter kene and cold. this cambinskan of which i have yow told  in royal vestiment sit on his deys with diademe ful heighe in his paleys  and halt his feste so solempne and so riche that in this world ne was ther noon it liche. of which if i shal tellen al tharray than wolde it occupye a someres day; and eek it nedeth nat for to devyse  at every cours the ordre of hir servyse. i wol nat tellen of hir strange sewes ne of hir swannes ne of hir heronsewes.  eek in that lond as tellen knightes olde ther is som mete that is ful deyntee holde  that in this lond men recche of it but smal; ther nis no man that may reporten al. i wol nat tarien yow for it is pryme and for it is no fruit but los of tyme; unto my firste i wol have my recours.  and so bifel that after the thridde cours whyl that this king sit thus in his nobleye herkninge his minstralles hir thinges pleye  biforn him at the bord deliciously in at the halledore al sodeynly  ther cam a knight upon a stede of bras and in his hand a brood mirour of glas. upon his thombe he hadde of gold a ring and by his syde a naked swerd hanging; and up he rydeth to the heighe bord.  in al the halle ne was ther spoke a word for merveille of this knight; him to biholde ful bisily ther wayten yonge and olde.  this strange knight that cam thus sodeynly al armed save his heed ful richely  salueth king and queen and lordes alle by ordre as they seten in the halle with so heigh reverence and obeisaunce as wel in speche as in contenaunce that gawain with his olde curteisye  though he were come ageyn out of fairye ne coude him nat amende with a word. and after this biforn the heighe bord  he with a manly voys seith his message after the forme used in his langage  withouten vyce of sillable or of lettre; and for his tale sholde seme the bettre accordant to his wordes was his chere as techeth art of speche hem that it lere; albeit that i can nat soune his style  ne can nat climben over so heigh a style yet seye i this as to commune entente thus muche amounteth al that ever he mente  if it so be that i have it in minde. he seyde the king of arabie and of inde  my lige lord on this solempne day salueth yow as he best can and may and sendeth yow in honour of your feste by me that am al redy at your heste this stede of bras that esily and wel  can in the space of o day naturel this is to seyn in foure and twenty houres wherso yow list in droghte or elles shoures  beren your body into every place to which your herte wilneth for to pace  withouten wem of yow thurgh foul or fair; or if yow list to fleen as hye in the air as doth an egle whan him list to sore this same stede shal bere yow evermore withouten harm til ye be ther yow leste  though that ye slepen on his bak or reste; and turne ayeyn with wrything of a pin. he that it wroghte coude ful many a gin;  he wayted many a constellacioun er he had doon this operacioun;  and knew ful many a seel and many a bond. this mirour eek that i have in myn hond hath swich a might that men may in it see whan ther shal fallen any adversitee unto your regne or to yourself also;  and openly who is your freend or foo. and over al this if any lady bright hath set hir herte on any maner wight  if he be fals she shal his treson see his newe love and al his subtiltee  so openly that ther shal nothing hyde. wherfor ageyn this lusty someres tyde this mirour and this ring that ye may see he hath sent to my lady canacee your excellente doghter that is here.  the vertu of the ring if ye wol here is this; that if hir lust it for to were upon hir thombe or in hir purs it bere  ther is no foul that fleeth under the hevene that she ne shal wel understonde his stevene  and knowe his mening openly and pleyn and answere him in his langage ageyn. and every gras that groweth upon rote she shal eek knowe and whom it wol do bote al be his woundes never so depe and wyde.  this naked swerd that hangeth by my syde swich vertu hath that what man so ye smyte thurghout his armure it wol kerve and byte  were it as thikke as is a branched ook; and what man that is wounded with the strook  shal never be hool til that yow list of grace to stroke him with the platte in thilke place ther he is hurt: this is as muche to seyn ye mote with the platte swerd ageyn stroke him in the wounde and it wol close;  this is a verray sooth withouten glose it failleth nat whyl it is in your hold. and whan this knight hath thus his tale told  he rydeth out of halle and doun he lighte. his stede which that shoon as sonne brighte  stant in the court as stille as any stoon. this knight is to his chambre lad anon and is unarmed and to mete yset. the presentes ben ful royally yfet this is to seyn the swerd and the mirour  and born anon into the heighe tour with certeine officers ordeyned therfore; and unto canacee this ring was bore  solempnely ther she sit at the table. but sikerly withouten any fable  the hors of bras that may nat be remewed it stant as it were to the ground yglewed. ther may no man out of the place it dryve for noon engyn of windas or polyve; and cause why for they can nat the craft.  and therefore in the place they han it laft til that the knight hath taught hem the manere to voyden him as ye shal after here.  greet was the prees that swarmeth to and fro to gauren on this hors that stondeth so;  for it so heigh was and so brood and long so wel proporcioned for to ben strong right as it were a stede of lumbardye; therwith so horsly and so quik of ye as it a gentil poileys courser were.  for certes fro his tayl unto his ere nature ne art ne coude him nat amende in no degree as al the peple wende.  but evermore hir moste wonder was how that it coude goon and was of bras;  it was of fairye as the peple semed. diverse folk diversely they demed; as many hedes as many wittes ther been. they murmureden as dooth a swarm of been and maden skiles after hir fantasyes  rehersinge of thise olde poetryes and seyden it was lyk the pegasee the hors that hadde winges for to flee;  or elles it was the grekes hors synon that broghte troye to destruccion  as men may in thise olde gestes rede myn herte quod oon is evermore in drede; i trowe som men of armes been therinne that shapen hem this citee for to winne. it were right good that al swich thing were knowe.  another rowned to his felawe lowe and seyde he lyeth it is rather lyk an apparence ymaad by som magyk  as iogelours pleyen at thise festes grete. of sondry doutes thus they iangle and trete  as lewed peple demeth comunly of thinges that ben maad more subtilly than they can in her lewednes comprehende; they demen gladly to the badder ende. and somme of hem wondred on the mirour  that born was up into the maistertour how men mighte in it swiche thinges see. another answerde and seyde it mighte wel be  naturelly by composiciouns of angles and of slye reflexiouns  and seyden that in rome was swich oon. they speken of alocen and vitulon and aristotle that writen in hir lyves of queynte mirours and of prospectyves as knowen they that han hir bokes herd.  and othere folk han wondred on the swerd that wolde percen thurghout everything; and fille in speche of thelophus the king  and of achilles with his queynte spere for he coude with it bothe hele and dere  right in swich wyse as men may with the swerd of which right now ye han yourselven herd. they speken of sondry harding of metal and speke of medicynes therwithal and how and whanne it sholde yharded be;  which is unknowe algates unto me. tho speke they of canacees ring and seyden alle that swich a wonder thing  of craft of ringes herde they never non save that he moyses and king salomon  hadde a name of konning in swich art. thus seyn the peple and drawen hem apart. but nathelees somme seyden that it was wonder to maken of fernasshen glas and yet nis glas nat lyk asshen of fern;  but for they han yknowen it so fern therfore cesseth her iangling and her wonder. as sore wondren somme on cause of thonder  on ebbe on flood on gossomer and on mist and alle thing til that the cause is wist.  thus iangle they and demen and devyse til that the king gan fro the bord aryse. phebus hath laft the angle meridional and yet ascending was the beest royal the gentil leon with his aldiran  whan that this tartre king this cambinskan roos fro his bord ther that he sat ful hye. toforn him gooth the loude minstralcye  til he cam to his chambre of parements ther as they sownen diverse instruments  that it is lyk an heven for to here. now dauncen lusty venus children dere for in the fish hir lady sat ful hye and loketh on hem with a freendly ye. this noble king is set up in his trone.  this strange knight is fet to him ful sone and on the daunce he gooth with canacee. heer is the revel and the iolitee  that is nat able a dul man to devyse. he moste han knowen love and his servyse  and been a festlich man as fresh as may that sholde yow devysen swich array. who coude telle yow the forme of daunces so uncouthe and so fresshe contenaunces swich subtil loking and dissimulinges  for drede of ialouse mennes aperceyvinges? no man but launcelot and he is deed. therefor i passe of al this lustiheed;  i seye namore but in this iolynesse i lete hem til men to the soper dresse.  the styward bit the spyces for to hye and eek the wyn in al this melodye. the usshers and the squyers ben ygoon; the spyces and the wyn is come anoon. they ete and drinke; and whan this hadde an ende  unto the temple as reson was they wende. the service doon they soupen al by day. what nedeth yow rehercen hir array?  ech man wot wel that at a kinges feeste hath plentee to the moste and to the leeste  and deyntees mo than been in my knowing. atafter soper gooth this noble king to seen this hors of bras with al the route of lordes and of ladyes him aboute. swich wondring was ther on this hors of bras  that sin the grete sege of troye was theras men wondreden on an hors also ne was ther swich a wondring as was tho.  but fynally the king axeth this knight the vertu of this courser and the might  and preyede him to telle his governaunce. this hors anoon bigan to trippe and daunce whan that this knight leyde hand upon his reyne and seyde sir ther is namore to seyne but whan yow list to ryden anywhere  ye moten trille a pin stant in his ere which i shall telle yow bitwix vs two. ye mote nempne him to what place also  or to what contree that yow list to ryde. and whan ye come ther as yow list abyde  bidde him descende and trille another pin for therin lyth the effect of al the gin and he wol doun descende and doon your wille; and in that place he wol abyde stille though al the world the contrarie hadde yswore;  he shal nat thennes ben ydrawe ne ybore. or if yow liste bidde him thennes goon trille this pin and he wol vanishe anoon  out of the sighte of every maner wight and come agayn be it by day or night  when that yow list to clepen him ageyn in swich a gyse as i shal to yow seyn bitwixe yow and me and that ful sone. ryde whan yow list ther is namore to done. enformed whan the king was of that knight  and hath conceyved in his wit aright the maner and the forme of al this thing thus glad and blythe this noble doughty king  repeireth to his revel as biforn. the brydel is unto the tour yborn  and kept among his iewels leve and dere. the hors vanisshed i noot in what manere out of hir sighte; ye gete namore of me. but thus i lete in lust and iolitee this cambinskan his lordes festeyinge  til wel ny the day bigan to springe. explicit prima pars. sequitur pars secunda. the norice of digestioun the slepe gan on hem winke and bad hem taken kepe  that muchel drink and labour wolde han reste; and with a galping mouth hem alle he keste  and seyde it was tyme to lye adoun for blood was in his dominacioun; cherissheth blood natures freend quod he. they thanken him galpinge by two by three and every wight gan drawe him to his reste  as slepe hem bad; they toke it for the beste. hir dremes shul nat been ytold for me; ful were hir hedes of fumositee  that causeth dreem of which ther nis no charge. they slepen til that it was pryme large  the moste part but it were canacee; she was ful mesurable as wommen be. for of hir fader hadde she take leve to gon to reste sone after it was eve; hir liste nat appalled for to be  nor on the morwe unfestlich for to see; and slepte hir firste sleep and thanne awook. for swich a ioye she in hir herte took  both of hir queynte ring and hir mirour that twenty tyme she changed hir colour;  and in hir slepe right for impressioun of hir mirour she hadde a visioun. wherfore er that the sonne gan up glyde she cleped on hir maistresse hir bisyde and seyde that hir liste for to ryse.  thise olde wommen that been gladly wyse as is hir maistresse answerde hir anoon and seyde madame whider wil ye goon  thus erly? for the folk ben alle on reste. i wol quod she aryse for me leste  no lenger for to slepe and walke aboute. hir maistresse clepeth wommen a gret route and up they rysen wel a ten or twelve; up ryseth fresshe canacee hirselve as rody and bright as dooth the yonge sonne  that in the ram is four degrees upronne; noon hyer was he whan she redy was; and forth she walketh esily a pas  arrayed after the lusty seson sote lightly for to pleye and walke on fote;  nat but with fyve or six of hir meynee; and in a trench forth in the park goth she. the vapour which that fro the erthe glood made the sonne to seme rody and brood; but nathelees it was so fair a sighte  that it made alle hir hertes for to lighte what for the seson and the morweninge and for the foules that she herde singe;  for right anon she wiste what they mente right by hir song and knew al hir entente.  the knotte why that every tale is told if it be taried til that lust be cold of hem that han it after herkned yore the savour passeth ever lenger the more for fulsomnesse of his prolixitee.  and by the same reson thinketh me i sholde to the knotte condescende and maken of hir walking sone an ende.  amidde a tree fordrye as whyt as chalk as canacee was pleying in hir walk  ther sat a faucon over hir heed ful hye that with a pitous voys so gan to crye that all the wode resouned of hir cry. ybeten hath she hirself so pitously with bothe hir winges til the rede blood  ran endelong the tree theras she stood. and ever in oon she cryde alwey and shrighte and with hir beek hirselven so she prighte  that ther nis tygre ne noon so cruel beste that dwelleth either in wode or in foreste  that nolde han wept if that he wepe coude for sorwe of hir she shrighte alwey so loude. for ther nas never yet no man on lyve if that i coude a faucon wel discryve that herde of swich another of fairnesse  as wel of plumage as of gentillesse of shap and al that mighte yrekened be. a faucon peregryn than semed she  of fremde land; and evermore as she stood she swowneth now and now for lakke of blood  til wel neigh is she fallen fro the tree. this faire kinges doghter canacee that on hir finger bar the queynte ring thurgh which she understood wel every thing that any foul may in his ledene seyn  and coude answere him in his ledene ageyn hath understonde what this faucon seyde and wel neigh for the rewthe almost she deyde.  and to the tree she gooth ful hastily and on this faucon loketh pitously  and heeld hir lappe abrood for wel she wiste the faucon moste fallen fro the twiste when that it swowned next for lakke of blood. a longe while to wayten hir she stood till atte laste she spak in this manere  unto the hauk as ye shul after here. what is the cause if it be for to telle that ye be in this furial pyne of helle?  quod canacee unto this hauk above. is this for sorwe of deeth or los of love?  for as i trowe thise ben causes two that causen moost a gentil herte wo; of other harm it nedeth nat to speke. for ye yourself upon yourself yow wreke which proveth wel that either love or drede  mot been encheson of your cruel dede sin that i see non other wight yow chace. for love of god as dooth yourselven grace  or what may ben your help; for west nor eest ne sey i never er now no brid ne beest  that ferde with himself so pitously. ye slee me with your sorwe verraily; i have of yow so gret compassioun. for goddes love com fro the tree adoun; and as i am a kinges doghter trewe  if that i verraily the cause knewe of your disese if it lay in my might i wolde amende it er that it were night  as wisly helpe me gret god of kinde! and herbes shal i right ynowe yfinde  to hele with your hurtes hastily. tho shrighte this faucon more pitously than ever she dide and fil to grounde anoon and lyth aswowne deed and lyk a stoon til canacee hath in hir lappe hir take  unto the tyme she gan of swough awake. and after that she of hir swough gan breyde right in hir haukes ledene thus she seyde:  that pitee renneth sone in gentil herte feling his similitude in peynes smerte  is preved alday as men may it see as wel by werk as by auctoritee; for gentil herte kytheth gentillesse. i see wel that ye han of my distresse compassioun my faire canacee  of verray wommanly benignitee that nature in your principles hath set. but for non hope for to fare the bet  but for to obeye unto your herte free and for to maken other be war by me  as by the whelp chasted is the leoun right for that cause and that conclusioun whyl that i have a leyser and a space myn harm i wol confessen er i pace. and ever whyl that oon hir sorwe tolde  that other weep as she to water wolde til that the faucon bad hir to be stille; and with a syk right thus she seyde hir wille.  ther i was bred allas! that harde day! and fostred in a roche of marbul gray  so tendrely that nothing eyled me i niste nat what was adversitee til i coude flee ful hye under the sky. tho dwelte a tercelet me faste by that semed welle of alle gentillesse;  al were he ful of treson and falsnesse it was so wrapped under humble chere and under hewe of trouthe in swich manere  under plesance and under bisy peyne that no wight coude han wend he coude feyne  so depe in greyn he dyed his coloures. right as a serpent hit him under floures til he may seen his tyme for to byte right so this god of love this ypocryte doth so his cerimonies and obeisaunces  and kepeth in semblant alle his observances that sowneth into gentillesse of love. as in a toumbe is al the faire above  and under is the corps swich as ye woot swich was this ypocryte bothe cold and hoot  and in this wyse he served his entente that save the feend non wiste what he mente. til he so longe had wopen and compleyned and many a yeer his service to me feyned til that myn herte to pitous and to nyce  al innocent of his crouned malice forfered of his deeth as thoughte me upon his othes and his seuretee  graunted him love on this condicioun that evermore myn honour and renoun  were saved bothe privee and apert; this is to seyn that after his desert i yaf him al myn herte and al my thoght god woot and he that otherwyse noght and took his herte in chaunge for myn for ay.  but sooth is seyd gon sithen many a day a trew wight and a theef thenken nat oon. and whan he saugh the thing so fer ygoon  that i had graunted him fully my love in swich a gyse as i have seyd above  and yeven him my trewe herte as free as he swoor he his herte yaf to me; anon this tygre ful of doublenesse fil on his knees with so devout humblesse with so heigh reverence and as by his chere  so lyk a gentil lovere of manere so ravisshed as it semed for the ioye that never iason ne parys of troye  iason? certes ne non other man sin lameth was that alderfirst bigan  to loven two as writen folk biforn ne never sin the firste man was born ne coude man by twenty thousand part countrefete the sophimes of his art; ne were worthy unbokele his galoche  ther doublenesse or feyning sholde approche ne so coude thanke a wight as he did me! his maner was an heven for to see  til any womman were she never so wys; so peynted he and kembde at pointdevys  as wel his wordes as his contenaunce. and i so lovede him for his obeisaunce and for the trouthe i demed in his herte that if so were that any thing him smerte al were it never so lyte and i it wiste  me thoughte i felte deeth myn herte twiste. and shortly so ferforth this thing is went that my wil was his willes instrument;  this is to seyn my wil obeyed his wil in alle thing as fer as reson fil  keping the boundes of my worship ever. ne never hadde i thing so leef ne lever as him god woot! ne never shal namo. this lasteth lenger than a yeer or two that i supposed of him noght but good.  but fynally thus atte laste it stood that fortune wolde that he moste twinne out of that place which that i was inne.  wher me was wo that is no questioun; i can nat make of it discripcioun;  for o thing dar i tellen boldely i knowe what is the peyne of deth therby; swich harm i felte for he ne mighte bileve. so on a day of me he took his leve so sorwefully eek that i wende verraily  that he had felt as muche harm as i whan that i herde him speke and saugh his hewe. but nathelees i thoughte he was so trewe  and eek that he repaire sholde ageyn withinne a litel whyle sooth to seyn;  and reson wolde eek that he moste go for his honour as ofte it happeth so that i made vertu of necessitee and took it wel sin that it moste be. as i best mighte i hidde fro him my sorwe  and took him by the hond seint iohn to borwe and seyde him thus: lo i am youres al; beth swich as i to yow have been and shal.  what he answerde it nedeth noght reherce who can sey bet than he who can do werse?  whan he hath al wel seyd thanne hath he doon. therfor bihoveth him a ful long spoon that shal ete with a feend thus herde i seye. so atte laste he moste forth his weye and forth he fleeth til he cam ther him leste.  whan it cam him to purpos for to reste i trowe he hadde thilke text in minde that alle thing repairing to his kinde  gladeth himself; thus seyn men as i gesse; men loven of propre kinde newfangelnesse  as briddes doon that men in cages fede. for though thou night and day take of hem hede and strawe hir cage faire and softe as silk and yeve hem sugre hony breed and milk yet right anon as that his dore is uppe  he with his feet wol spurne adoun his cuppe and to the wode he wol and wormes ete; so newefangel been they of hir mete  and loven novelryes of propre kinde; no gentillesse of blood ne may hem binde.  so ferde this tercelet allas the day! though he were gentil born and fresh and gay and goodly for to seen and humble and free he saugh upon a tyme a kyte flee and sodeynly he loved this kyte so  that al his love is clene fro me ago and hath his trouthe falsed in this wyse; thus hath the kyte my love in hir servyse  and i am lorn withouten remedye! and with that word this faucon gan to crye  and swowned eft in canacees barme. greet was the sorwe for the haukes harme that canacee and alle hir wommen made; they niste how they mighte the faucon glade. but canacee hom bereth hir in hir lappe  and softely in plastres gan hir wrappe ther as she with hir beek had hurt hirselve. now can nat canacee but herbes delve  out of the grounde and make salves newe of herbes precious and fyne of hewe  to helen with this hauk; fro day to night she dooth hir bisinesse and al hir might. and by hir beddes heed she made a mewe and covered it with veluettes blewe in signe of trouthe that is in wommen sene.  and al withoute the mewe is peynted grene in which were peynted alle thise false foules as beth thise tidifs tercelets and oules  right for despyt were peynted hem bisyde and pyes on hem for to crye and chyde.  thus lete i canacee hir hauk keping; i wol namore as now speke of hir ring til it come eft to purpos for to seyn how that this faucon gat hir love ageyn repentant as the storie telleth us  by mediacioun of cambalus the kinges sone of whiche i yow tolde. but hennesforth i wol my proces holde  to speke of aventures and of batailles that never yet was herd so grete mervailles.  first wol i telle yow of cambinskan that in his tyme many a citee wan; and after wol i speke of algarsyf how that he wan theodora to his wyf for whom ful ofte in greet peril he was  ne hadde he ben holpen by the stede of bras; and after wol i speke of cambalo that faught in listes with the bretheren two  for canacee er that he mighte hir winne. and ther i lefte i wol ageyn biginne.  explicit secunda pars. incipit pars tercia. appollo whirleth up his char so hye t. om. til that the god mercurius hous the slye t. om. here folwen the wordes of the frankelin to the squier and the wordes of the host to the frankelin. in feith squier thou hast thee wel yquit and gentilly i preise wel thy wit quod the frankeleyn considering thy youthe  so feelingly thou spekest sir i allow the! as to my doom there is non that is here of eloquence that shal be thy pere if that thou live; god yeve thee good chaunce and in vertu sende thee continuaunce!  for of thy speche i have greet deyntee. i have a sone and by the trinitee  i hadde lever than twenty pound worth lond though it right now were fallen in myn hond he were a man of swich discrecioun  as that ye been! fy on possessioun butif a man be vertuous withal. i have my sone snibbed and yet shal for he to vertu listeth nat entende; but for to pleye at dees and to despende  and lese al that he hath is his usage. and he hath lever talken with a page  than to comune with any gentil wight ther he mighte lerne gentillesse aright. straw for your gentillesse quod our host;  what frankeleyn? pardee sir wel thou wost that eche of yow mot tellen atte leste a tale or two or breken his biheste. that knowe i wel sir quod the frankeleyn; i prey yow haveth me nat in desdeyn  though to this man i speke a word or two. telle on thy tale withouten wordes mo.  gladly sir host quod he i wol obeye unto your wil; now herkneth what i seye. i wol yow nat contrarien in no wyse  as fer as that my wittes wol suffyse; i prey to god that it may plesen yow than woot i wel that it is good ynow. the prologe of the frankeleyns tale. thise olde gentil britons in hir dayes of diverse aventures maden layes  rymeyed in hir firste briton tonge; which layes with hir instruments they songe  or elles redden hem for hir plesaunce; and oon of hem have i in remembraunce which i shal seyn with good wil as i can.  but sires bycause i am a burel man at my biginning first i yow biseche have me excused of my rude speche; i lerned never rethoryk certeyn; thing that i speke it moot be bare and pleyn.  i sleep never on the mount of pernaso ne lerned marcus tullius cithero.  colours ne knowe i none withouten drede but swiche colours as growen in the mede or elles swiche as men dye or peynte.  colours of rethoryk ben me to queynte; my spirit feleth noght of swich matere. but if yow list my tale shul ye here. here biginneth the frankeleyns tale. in armorik that called is britayne ther was a knight that loved and dide his payne  to serve a lady in his beste wyse; and many a labour many a greet empryse he for his lady wroghte er she were wonne. for she was oon the faireste under sonne and eek therto come of so heigh kinrede  that wel unnethes dorste this knight for drede telle hir his wo his peyne and his distresse. but atte laste she for his worthinesse  and namely for his meke obeysaunce hath swich a pitee caught of his penaunce  that prively she fil of his accord to take him for hir housbonde and hir lord of swich lordshipe as men han over hir wyves; and for to lede the more in blisse hir lyves of his free wil he swoor hir as a knight  that never in al his lyf he day ne night ne sholde upon him take no maistrye agayn hir wil ne kythe hir ialousye  but hir obeye and folwe hir wil in al as any lovere to his lady shal;  save that the name of soveraynetee that wolde he have for shame of his degree. she thanked him and with ful greet humblesse she seyde sire sith of your gentillesse ye profre me to have so large a reyne  ne wolde never god bitwixe us tweyne as in my gilt were outher werre or stryf. sir i wol be your humble trewe wyf  have heer my trouthe til that myn herte breste. thus been they bothe in quiete and in reste.  for o thing sires saufly dar i seye that frendes everich other moot obeye if they wol longe holden companye. love wol nat ben constreyned by maistrye; whan maistrie comth the god of love anon  beteth hise winges and farewel! he is gon! love is a thing as any spirit free; wommen of kinde desiren libertee  and nat to ben constreyned as a thral; and so don men if i soth seyen shal.  loke who that is most pacient in love he is at his avantage al above. pacience is an heigh vertu certeyn; for it venquisseth as thise clerkes seyn thinges that rigour sholde never atteyne.  for every word men may nat chyde or pleyne. lerneth to suffre or elles so moot i goon ye shul it lerne wherso ye wole or noon.  for in this world certein ther no wight is that he ne dooth or seith somtyme amis.  ire siknesse or constellacioun wyn wo or chaunginge of complexioun causeth ful ofte to doon amis or speken. on every wrong a man may nat be wreken; after the tyme moste be temperaunce  to every wight that can on governaunce. and therfore hath this wyse worthy knight to live in ese suffrance hir bihight  and she to him ful wisly gan to swere that never sholde ther be defaute in here.  heer may men seen an humble wys accord; thus hath she take hir servant and hir lord servant in love and lord in mariage; than was he bothe in lordship and servage; servage? nay but in lordshipe above  sith he hath bothe his lady and his love; his lady certes and his wyf also the which that lawe of love acordeth to.  and whan he was in this prosperitee hoom with his wyf he gooth to his contree  nat fer fro penmark ther his dwelling was wheras he liveth in blisse and in solas. who coude telle but he had wedded be the ioye the ese and the prosperitee that is bitwixe an housbonde and his wyf?  a yeer and more lasted this blisful lyf til that the knight of which i speke of thus that of kayrrud was cleped arveragus  shoop him to goon and dwelle a yeer or tweyne in engelond that cleped was eek briteyne  to seke in armes worship and honour; for al his lust he sette in swich labour; and dwelled ther two yeer the book seith thus. now wol i stinte of this arveragus and speken i wole of dorigene his wyf  that loveth hir housbonde as hir hertes lyf. for his absence wepeth she and syketh as doon thise noble wyves whan hem lyketh.  she moorneth waketh wayleth fasteth pleyneth; desyr of his presence hir so distreyneth  that al this wyde world she sette at noght. hir frendes whiche that knewe hir hevy thoght conforten hir in al that ever they may; they prechen hir they telle hir night and day that causelees she sleeth hirself allas!  and every confort possible in this cas they doon to hir with al hir bisinesse al for to make hir leve hir hevinesse.  by proces as ye knowen everichoon men may so longe graven in a stoon  til som figure therinne emprented be. so longe han they conforted hir til she receyved hath by hope and by resoun the emprenting of hir consolacioun thurgh which hir grete sorwe gan aswage;  she may nat alwey duren in swich rage. and eek arveragus in al this care hath sent hir lettres hoom of his welfare  and that he wol come hastily agayn; or elles hadde this sorwe hir herte slayn.  hir freendes sawe hir sorwe gan to slake and preyede hir on knees for goddes sake to come and romen hir in companye awey to dryve hir derke fantasye. and finally she graunted that requeste;  for wel she saugh that it was for the beste. now stood hir castel faste by the see and often with hir freendes walketh she  hir to disporte upon the bank an heigh wheras she many a ship and barge seigh  seilinge hir cours wheras hem liste go; but than was that a parcel of hir wo. for to hirself ful ofte allas! seith she is ther no ship of so manye as i see wol bringen hom my lord? than were myn herte  al warisshed of his bittre peynes smerte. another tyme ther wolde she sitte and thinke and caste hir eyen dounward fro the brinke.  but whan she saugh the grisly rokkes blake for verray fere so wolde hir herte quake  that on hir feet she mighte hir noght sustene. than wolde she sitte adoun upon the grene and pitously into the see biholde and seyn right thus with sorweful sykes colde: eterne god that thurgh thy purveyaunce  ledest the world by certein governaunce in ydel as men seyn ye nothing make; but lord thise grisly feendly rokkes blake  that semen rather a foul confusioun of werk than any fair creacioun  of swich a parfit wys god and a stable why han ye wroght this werk unresonable? for by this werk south north ne west ne eest ther nis yfostred man ne brid ne beest; it dooth no good to my wit but anoyeth.  see ye nat lord how mankinde it destroyeth? an hundred thousand bodies of mankinde han rokkes slayn al be they nat in minde  which mankinde is so fair part of thy werk that thou it madest lyk to thyn owene merk.  than semed it ye hadde a greet chiertee toward mankinde; but how than may it be that ye swiche menes make it to destroyen whiche menes do no good but ever anoyen? i wool wel clerkes wol seyn as hem leste  by arguments that al is for the beste though i ne can the causes nat yknowe. but thilke god that made wind to blowe  as kepe my lord! this my conclusioun; to clerkes lete i al disputisoun.  but wolde god that alle thise rokkes blake were sonken into helle for his sake! thise rokkes sleen myn herte for the fere. thus wolde she seyn with many a pitous tere. hir freendes sawe that it was no disport  to romen by the see but disconfort; and shopen for to pleyen somwher elles. they leden hir by riveres and by welles  and eek in othere places delitables; they dauncen and they pleyen at ches and tables.  so on a day right in the morwetyde unto a gardin that was ther bisyde in which that they had maad hir ordinaunce of vitaille and of other purveyaunce they goon and pleye hem al the longe day.  and this was on the sixte morwe of may which may had peynted with his softe shoures this gardin ful of leves and of floures;  and craft of mannes hand so curiously arrayed hadde this gardin trewely  that never was ther gardin of swich prys butif it were the verray paradys. the odour of floures and the fresshe sighte wolde han maad any herte for to lighte that ever was born butif to gret siknesse  or to gret sorwe helde it in distresse; so ful it was of beautee with plesaunce. atafter diner gonne they to daunce  and singe also save dorigen allone which made alwey hir compleint and hir mone;  for she ne saugh him on the daunce go that was hir housbonde and hir love also. but nathelees she moste a tyme abyde and with good hope lete hir sorwe slyde. upon this daunce amonges othere men  daunced a squyer biforen dorigen that fressher was and iolyer of array as to my doom than is the monthe of may.  he singeth daunceth passinge any man that is or was sith that the world bigan.  therwith he was if men sholde him discryve oon of the beste faringe man onlyve; yong strong right vertuous and riche and wys and wel biloved and holden in gret prys. and shortly if the sothe i tellen shal  unwiting of this dorigen at al this lusty squyer servant to venus which that ycleped was aurelius  had loved hir best of any creature two yeer and more as was his aventure  but never dorste he telle hir his grevaunce; withouten coppe he drank al his penaunce. he was despeyred nothing dorste he seye save in his songes somwhat wolde he wreye his wo as in a general compleyning;  he seyde he lovede and was biloved nothing. of swich matere made he manye layes songes compleintes roundels virelayes  how that he dorste nat his sorwe telle but languissheth as a furie dooth in helle;  and dye he moste he seyde as dide ekko for narcisus that dorste nat telle hir wo. in other manere than ye here me seye ne dorste he nat to hir his wo biwreye; save that paraventure somtyme at daunces  ther yonge folk kepen hir observaunces it may wel be he loked on hir face in swich a wyse as man that asketh grace;  but nothing wiste she of his entente. nathelees it happed er they thennes wente  bycause that he was hir neighebour and was a man of worship and honour and hadde yknowen him of tyme yore they fille in speche; and forth more and more unto his purpos drough aurelius  and whan he saugh his tyme he seyde thus: madame quod he by god that this world made so that i wiste it mighte your herte glade  i wolde that day that your arveragus wente over the see that i aurelius  had went ther never i sholde have come agayn; for wel i woot my service is in vayn. my guerdon is but bresting of myn herte; madame reweth upon my peynes smerte; for with a word ye may me sleen or save  heer at your feet god wolde that i were grave! i ne have as now no leyser more to seye; have mercy swete or ye wol do me deye!  she gan to loke upon aurelius: is this your wil quod she and sey ye thus?  never erst quod she ne wiste i what ye mente. but now aurelie i knowe your entente by thilke god that yaf me soule and lyf ne shal i never been untrewe wyf in word ne werk as fer as i have wit:  i wol ben his to whom that i am knit; tak this for fynal answer as of me. but after that in pley thus seyde she:  aurelie quod she by heighe god above yet wolde i graunte yow to been your love  sin i yow see so pitously complayne; loke what day that endelong britayne ye remoeve alle the rokkes stoon by stoon that they ne lette ship ne boot to goon i seye whan ye han maad the coost so clene  of rokkes that ther nis no stoon ysene than wol i love yow best of any man; have heer my trouthe in al that ever i can.  is ther non other grace in yow quod he. no by that lord quod she that maked me!  for wel i woot that it shal never bityde. lat swiche folies out of your herte slyde. what deyntee sholde a man han in his lyf for to go love another mannes wyf that hath hir body whan so that him lyketh?  aurelius ful ofte sore syketh; wo was aurelie whan that he this herde and with a sorweful herte he thus answerde:  madame quod he this were an inpossible! than moot i dye of sodein deth horrible.  and with that word he turned him anoon. tho come hir othere freendes many oon and in the aleyes romeden up and doun and nothing wiste of this conclusioun but sodeinly bigonne revel newe  til that the brighte sonne loste his hewe; for thorisonte hath reft the sonne his light; this is as muche to seye as it was night.  and hoom they goon in ioye and in solas save only wrecche aurelius allas!  he to his hous is goon with sorweful herte; he seeth he may nat fro his deeth asterte. him semed that he felte his herte colde; up to the hevene his handes he gan holde and on his knowes bare he sette him doun  and in his raving seyde his orisoun. for verray wo out of his wit he breyde. he niste what he spak but thus he seyde;  with pitous herte his pleynt hath he bigonne unto the goddes and first unto the sonne:  he seyde appollo god and governour of every plaunte herbe tree and flour that yevest after thy declinacioun to ech of hem his tyme and his sesoun as thyn herberwe chaungeth lowe or hye  lord phebus cast thy merciable ye on wrecche aurelie which that am but lorn. lo lord! my lady hath my deeth ysworn  withoute gilt but thy benignitee upon my dedly herte have som pitee!  for wel i woot lord phebus if yow lest ye may me helpen save my lady best. now voucheth sauf that i may yow devyse how that i may been holpe and in what wyse. your blisful suster lucina the shene  that of the see is chief goddesse and quene though neptunus have deitee in the see yet emperesse aboven him is she:  ye knowen wel lord that right as hir desyr is to be quiked and lightned of your fyr  for which she folweth yow ful bisily right so the see desyreth naturelly to folwen hir as she that is goddesse bothe in the see and riveres more and lesse. wherfore lord phebus this is my requeste  do this miracle or do myn herte breste that now next at this opposicioun which in the signe shal be of the leoun  as preyeth hir so greet a flood to bringe that fyve fadme at the leeste it overspringe  the hyeste rokke in armorik briteyne; and lat this flood endure yeres tweyne; than certes to my lady may i seye: holdeth your heste the rokkes been aweye. lord phebus dooth this miracle for me;  preye hir she go no faster cours than ye; i seye preyeth your suster that she go no faster cours than ye thise yeres two.  than shal she been evene atte fulle alway and springflood laste bothe night and day.  and but she vouchesauf in swiche manere to graunte me my sovereyn lady dere prey hir to sinken every rok adoun into hir owene derke regioun under the ground ther pluto dwelleth inne  or nevermo shal i my lady winne. thy temple in delphos wol i barefoot seke; lord phebus see the teres on my cheke  and of my peyne have som compassioun. and with that word in swowne he fil adoun  and longe tyme he lay forth in a traunce. his brother which that knew of his penaunce up caughte him and to bedde he hath him broght. dispeyred in this torment and this thoght lete i this woful creature lye;  chese he for me whether he wol live or dye. arveragus with hele and greet honour as he that was of chivalrye the flour  is comen hoom and othere worthy men. o blisful artow now thou dorigen  that hast thy lusty housbonde in thyne armes the fresshe knight the worthy man of armes that loveth thee as his owene hertes lyf. nothing list him to been imaginatyf if any wight had spoke whyl he was oute  to hire of love; he hadde of it no doute. he noght entendeth to no swich matere but daunceth iusteth maketh hir good chere;  and thus in ioye and blisse i lete hem dwelle and of the syke aurelius wol i telle.  in langour and in torment furious two yeer and more lay wrecche aurelius er any foot he mighte on erthe goon; ne confort in this tyme hadde he noon save of his brother which that was a clerk;  he knew of al this wo and al this werk. for to non other creature certeyn of this matere he dorste no word seyn.  under his brest he bar it more secree than ever dide pamphilus for galathee.  his brest was hool withoute for to sene but in his herte ay was the arwe kene. and wel ye knowe that of a sursanure in surgerye is perilous the cure but men mighte touche the arwe or come therby.  his brother weep and wayled prively til atte laste him fil in remembraunce that whyl he was at orliens in fraunce  as yonge clerkes that been likerous to reden artes that been curious  seken in every halke and every herne particuler sciences for to lerne he him remembred that upon a day at orliens in studie a book he say of magik natural which his felawe  that was that tyme a bacheler of lawe al were he ther to lerne another craft had prively upon his desk ylaft;  which book spak muchel of the operaciouns touchinge the eighte and twenty mansiouns  that longen to the mone and swich folye as in our dayes is nat worth a flye; for holy chirches feith in our bileve ne suffreth noon illusion us to greve. and whan this book was in his remembraunce  anon for ioye his herte gan to daunce and to himself he seyde prively: my brother shal be warisshed hastily;  for i am siker that ther be sciences by whiche men make diverse apparences  swiche as thise subtile tregetoures pleye. for ofte at festes have i wel herd seye that tregetours withinne an halle large have maad come in a water and a barge and in the halle rowen up and doun.  somtyme hath semed come a grim leoun; and somtyme floures springe as in a mede; somtyme a vyne and grapes whyte and rede;  somtyme a castel al of lym and stoon; and whan hem lyked voyded it anoon.  thus semed it to every mannes sighte. now than conclude i thus that if i mighte at orliens som old felawe yfinde that hadde this mones mansions in minde or other magik naturel above  he sholde wel make my brother han his love. for with an apparence a clerk may make to mannes sighte that alle the rokkes blake  of britaigne weren yvoyded everichon and shippes by the brinke comen and gon  and in swich forme endure a day or two; than were my brother warisshed of his wo. than moste she nedes holden hir biheste or elles he shal shame hir atte leste. what sholde i make a lenger tale of this?  unto his brotheres bed he comen is and swich confort he yaf him for to gon to orliens that he up stirte anon  and on his wey forthward thanne is he fare in hope for to ben lissed of his care.  whan they were come almost to that citee butif it were a two furlong or three a yong clerk rominge by himself they mette which that in latin thriftily hem grette and after that he seyde a wonder thing:  i knowe quod he the cause of your coming; and er they ferther any fote wente he tolde hem al that was in hir entente.  this briton clerk him asked of felawes the whiche that he had knowe in olde dawes;  and he answerde him that they dede were for which he weep ful ofte many a tere. doun of his hors aurelius lighte anon and forth with this magicien is he gon hoom to his hous and made hem wel at ese.  hem lakked no vitaille that mighte hem plese; so wel arrayed hous as ther was oon aurelius in his lyf saugh never noon.  he shewed him er he wente to sopeer forestes parkes ful of wilde deer;  ther saugh he hertes with hir homes hye the gretteste that ever were seyn with ye. he saugh of hem an hondred slayn with houndes and somme with arwes blede of bittre woundes. he saugh whan voided were thise wilde deer  thise fauconers upon a fair river that with hir haukes han the heron slayn. tho saugh he knightes iusting in a playn;  and after this he dide him swich plesaunce that he him shewed his lady on a daunce  on which himself he daunced as him thoughte. and whan this maister that this magik wroughte saugh it was tyme he clapte his handes two and farewel! al our revel was ago. and yet remoeved they never out of the hous  whyl they saugh al this sighte merveillous but in his studie theras his bookes be they seten stille and no wight but they three.  to him this maister called his squyer and seyde him thus: is redy our soper?  almost an houre it is i undertake sith i yow bad our soper for to make whan that thise worthy men wenten with me into my studie theras my bookes be. sire quod this squyer whan it lyketh yow  it is al redy though ye wol right now. go we than soupe quod he as for the beste; this amorous folk somtyme mote han reste.  atafter soper fille they in tretee what somme sholde this maistres guerdon be  to remoeven alle the rokkes of britayne and eek from gerounde to the mouth of sayne. he made it straunge and swoor so god him save lasse than a thousand pound he wolde nat have ne gladly for that somme he wolde nat goon.  aurelius with blisful herte anoon answerde thus fy on a thousand pound! this wyde world which that men seye is round  i wolde it yeve if i were lord of it. this bargayn is ful drive for we ben knit.  ye shal be payed trewely by my trouthe! but loketh now for no necligence or slouthe ye tarie us heer no lenger than tomorwe. nay quod this clerk have heer my feith to borwe. to bedde is goon aurelius whan him leste  and wel ny al that night he hadde his reste; what for his labour and his hope of blisse his woful herte of penaunce hadde a lisse.  upon the morwe whan that it was day to britaigne toke they the righte way  aurelius and this magicien bisyde and been descended ther they wolde abyde; and this was as the bokes me remembre the colde frosty seson of decembre. phebus wex old and hewed lyk latoun  that in his hote declinacioun shoon as the burned gold with stremes brighte; but now in capricorn adoun he lighte  wheras he shoon ful pale i dar wel seyn. the bittre frostes with the sleet and reyn  destroyed hath the grene in every yerd. ianus sit by the fyr with double berd and drinketh of his buglehorn the wyn. biforn him stant braun of the tusked swyn and nowel cryeth every lusty man.  aurelius in al that ever he can doth to his maister chere and reverence and preyeth him to doon his diligence  to bringen him out of his peynes smerte or with a swerd that he wolde slitte his herte.  this subtil clerk swich routhe had of this man that night and day he spedde him that he can to wayte a tyme of his conclusioun; this is to seye to make illusioun by swich an apparence or iogelrye  i ne can no termes of astrologye that she and every wight sholde wene and seye that of britaigne the rokkes were aweye  or elles they were sonken under grounde. so atte laste he hath his tyme yfounde  to maken his iapes and his wrecchednesse of swich a superstitious cursednesse. his tables toletanes forth he broght ful wel corrected ne ther lakked noght neither his collect ne his expans yeres  ne his rotes ne his othere geres as been his centres and his arguments and his proporcionels convenients  for his equacions in every thing. and by his eighte spere in his wirking  he knew ful wel how fer alnath was shove fro the heed of thilke fixe aries above that in the ninthe speere considered is; ful subtilly he calculed al this. whan he had founde his firste mansioun  he knew the remenant by proporcioun; and knew the arysing of his mone weel and in whos face and terme and everydeel;  and knew ful weel the mones mansioun acordaunt to his operacioun  and knew also his othere observaunces for swiche illusiouns and swiche meschaunces as hethen folk used in thilke dayes; for which no lenger maked he delayes but thurgh his magik for a wyke or tweye  it semed that alle the rokkes were aweye. aurelius which that yet despeired is wher he shal han his love or fare amis  awaiteth night and day on this miracle; and whan he knew that ther was noon obstacle  that voided were thise rokkes everichon doun to his maistres feet he fil anon and seyde i woful wrecche aurelius thanke yow lord and lady myn venus that me han holpen fro my cares colde:  and to the temple his wey forth hath he holde wheras he knew he sholde his lady see. and whan he saugh his tyme anonright he  with dredful herte and with ful humble chere salewed hath his sovereyn lady dere:  my righte lady quod this woful man whom i most drede and love as i best can and lothest were of al this world displese nere it that i for yow have swich disese that i moste dyen heer at your foot anon  noght wolde i telle how me is wo bigon; but certes outher moste i dye or pleyne; ye slee me giltelees for verray peyne.  but of my deeth thogh that ye have no routhe avyseth yow er that ye breke your trouthe.  repenteth yow for thilke god above er ye me sleen bycause that i yow love. for madame wel ye woot what ye han hight; nat that i chalange any thing of right of yow my sovereyn lady but your grace;  but in a gardin yond at swich a place ye woot right wel what ye bihighten me; and in myn hand your trouthe plighten ye  to love me best god woot ye seyde so al be that i unworthy be therto.  madame i speke it for the honour of yow more than to save myn hertes lyf right now; i have do so as ye comanded me; and if ye vouchesauf ye may go see. doth as yow list have your biheste in minde  for quik or deed right ther ye shul me finde; in yow lyth al to do me live or deye; but wel i woot the rokkes been aweye!  he taketh his leve and she astonied stood in al hir face nas a drope of blood;  she wende never han come in swich a trappe: allas! quod she that ever this sholde happe! for wende i never by possibilitee that swich a monstre or merveille mighte be! it is agayns the proces of nature:  and hoom she gooth a sorweful creature. for verray fere unnethe may she go she wepeth wailleth al a day or two  and swowneth that it routhe was to see; but why it was to no wight tolde she;  for out of toune was goon arveragus. but to hirself she spak and seyde thus with face pale and with ful sorweful chere in hir compleynt as ye shul after here: allas quod she on thee fortune i pleyne  that unwar wrapped hast me in thy cheyne; for which tescape woot i no socour save only deeth or elles dishonour;  oon of thise two bihoveth me to chese. but nathelees yet have i lever to lese  my lyf than of my body have a shame or knowe myselven fals or lese my name and with my deth i may be quit ywis. hath ther nat many a noble wyf er this and many a mayde yslayn hirself allas!  rather than with hir body doon trespas? yis certes lo thise stories beren witnesse; whan thretty tyraunts ful of cursednesse  had slayn phidoun in athenes atte feste they comanded his doghtres for tareste  and bringen hem biforn hem in despyt al naked to fulfille hir foul delyt and in hir fadres blood they made hem daunce upon the pavement god yeve hem mischaunce! for which thise woful maydens ful of drede  rather than they wolde lese hir maydenhede they prively ben stirt into a welle and dreynte hemselven as the bokes telle.  they of messene lete enquere and seke of lacedomie fifty maydens eke  on whiche they wolden doon hir lecherye; but was ther noon of al that companye that she nas slayn and with a good entente chees rather for to dye than assente to been oppressed of hir maydenhede.  why sholde i thanne to dye been in drede? lo eek the tiraunt aristoclides that loved a mayden heet stimphalides  whan that hir fader slayn was on a night unto dianes temple goth she right  and hente the image in hir handes two fro which image wolde she never go. no wight ne mighte hir handes of it arace til she was slayn right in the selve place. now sith that maydens hadden swich despyt  to been defouled with mannes foul delyt wel oghte a wyf rather hirselven slee than be defouled as it thinketh me.  what shal i seyn of hasdrubales wyf that at cartage birafte hirself hir lyf?  for whan she saugh that romayns wan the toun she took hir children alle and skipte adoun into the fyr and chees rather to dye than any romayn dide hir vileinye. hath nat lucresse yslayn hirself allas!  at rome whanne she oppressed was of tarquin for hir thoughte it was a shame to liven whan she hadde lost hir name?  the sevene maydens of milesie also han slayn hemself for verray drede and wo  rather than folk of gaule hem sholde oppresse. mo than a thousand stories as i gesse coude i now telle as touchinge this matere. whan habradate was slayn his wyf so dere hirselven slow and leet hir blood to glyde  in habradates woundes depe and wyde and seyde my body at the leeste way ther shal no wight defoulen if i may.  what sholde i mo ensamples heerof sayn sith that so manye han hemselven slayn  wel rather than they wolde defouled be? i wol conclude that it is bet for me to sleen myself than been defouled thus. i wol be trewe unto arveragus or rather sleen myself in som manere  as dide demociones doghter dere bycause that she wolde nat defouled be. o cedasus! it is ful greet pitee  to reden how thy doghtren deyde allas! that slowe hemselven for swich maner cas.  as greet a pitee was it or wel more the theban mayden that for nichanore hirselven slow right for swich maner wo. another theban mayden dide right so; for oon of macedoine hadde hir oppressed  she with hir deeth hir maydenhede redressed. what shal i seye of nicerates wyf that for swich cas birafte hirself hir lyf?  how trewe eek was to alcebiades his love that rather for to dyen chees  than for to suffre his body unburied be! lo which a wyf was alceste quod she. what seith omer of gode penalopee? al grece knoweth of hir chastitee. pardee of laodomya is writen thus  that whan at troye was slayn protheselaus no lenger wolde she live after his day. the same of noble porcia telle i may;  withoute brutus coude she nat live to whom she hadde al hool hir herte yive.  the parfit wyfhod of arthemesye honoured is thurgh al the barbarye o teuta queen! thy wyfly chastitee to alle wyves may a mirour be. the same thing i seye of bilia t. om. of rodogone and eek valeria. t. om. thus pleyned dorigene a day or tweye purposinge ever that she wolde deye.  but nathelees upon the thridde night hom cam arveragus this worthy knight  and asked hir why that she weep so sore? and she gan wepen ever lenger the more. allas! quod she that ever was i born! thus have i seyd quod she thus have i sworn and told him al as ye han herd bifore;  it nedeth nat reherce it yow namore. this housbond with glad chere in freendly wyse answerde and seyde as i shal yow devyse:  is ther oght elles dorigen but this? nay nay quod she god help me so as wis;  this is to muche and it were goddes wille. ye wyf quod he lat slepen that is stille; it may be wel paraventure yet today. ye shul your trouthe holden by my fay! for god so wisly have mercy on me  i hadde wel lever ystiked for to be for verray love which that i to yow have butif ye sholde your trouthe kepe and save.  trouthe is the hyeste thing that man may kepe: but with that word he brast anon to wepe  and seyde i yow forbede up peyne of deeth that never whyl thee lasteth lyf ne breeth to no wight tel thou of this aventure. as i may best i wol my wo endure ne make no contenance of hevinesse  that folk of yow may demen harm or gesse. and forth he cleped a squyer and a mayde: goth forth anon with dorigen he sayde  and bringeth hir to swich a place anon. they take hir leve and on hir wey they gon;  but they ne wiste why she thider wente. he nolde no wight tellen his entente.  paraventure an heep of yow ywis t. om. wol holden him a lewed man in this t. om. that he wol putte his wyf in iupartye; t. om. herkneth the tale er ye upon hir crye. t. om. she may have bettre fortune than yow semeth; t. om. and whan that ye han herd the tale demeth. t. om. this squyer which that highte aurelius  on dorigen that was so amorous  of aventure happed hir to mete amidde the toun right in the quikkest strete as she was boun to goon the wey forthright toward the gardin theras she had hight. and he was to the gardinward also;  for wel he spyed whan she wolde go out of hir hous to any maner place. but thus they mette of aventure or grace;  and he saleweth hir with glad entente and asked of hir whiderward she wente? and she answerde half as she were mad unto the gardin as myn housbond bad my trouthe for to holde allas! allas! aurelius gan wondren on this cas and in his herte had greet compassioun  of hir and of hir lamentacioun and of arveragus the worthy knight that bad hir holden al that she had hight  so looth him was his wyf sholde breke hir trouthe; and in his herte he caughte of this greet routhe  consideringe the beste on every syde that fro his lust yet were him lever abyde than doon so heigh a cherlish wrecchednesse agayns franchyse and alle gentillesse; for which in fewe wordes seyde he thus:  madame seyth to your lord arveragus that sith i see his grete gentillesse  to yow and eek i see wel your distresse that him were lever han shame and that were routhe than ye to me sholde breke thus your trouthe  i have wel lever ever to suffre wo than i departe the love bitwix yow two. i yow relesse madame into your hond quit every surement and every bond that ye han maad to me as heerbiforn  sith thilke tyme which that ye were born. my trouthe i plighte i shal yow never repreve of no biheste and here i take my leve  as of the treweste and the beste wyf that ever yet i knew in al my lyf.  but every wyf bewar of hir biheste on dorigene remembreth atte leste. thus can a squyer doon a gentil dede as well as can a knight withouten drede. she thonketh him upon hir knees al bare  and hoom unto hir housbond is she fare and tolde him al as ye han herd me sayd; and be ye siker he was so weel apayd  that it were inpossible me to wryte; what sholde i lenger of this cas endyte?  arveragus and dorigene his wyf in sovereyn blisse leden forth hir lyf. never eft ne was ther angre hem bitwene; he cherisseth hir as though she were a quene; and she was to him trewe for evermore.  of thise two folk ye gete of me namore. aurelius that his cost hath al forlorn curseth the tyme that ever he was born:  allas quod he allas! that i bihighte of pured gold a thousand pound of wighte  unto this philosophre! how shal i do? i see namore but that i am fordo. myn heritage moot i nedes selle and been a begger; heer may i nat dwelle and shamen al my kinrede in this place  but i of him may gete bettre grace. but nathelees i wol of him assaye at certeyn dayes yeer by yeer to paye  and thanke him of his grete curteisye; my trouthe wol i kepe i wol nat lye.  with herte soor he gooth unto his cofre and broghte gold unto this philosophre the value of fyve hundred pound i gesse and him bisecheth of his gentillesse to graunte him dayes of the remenaunt  and seyde maister i dar wel make avaunt i failled never of my trouthe as yit; for sikerly my dette shal be quit  towardes yow however that i fare to goon abegged in my kirtle bare.  but wolde ye vouchesauf upon seurtee two yeer or three for to respyten me than were i wel; for elles moot i selle myn heritage; ther is namore to telle. this philosophre sobrely answerde  and seyde thus whan he thise wordes herde: have i nat holden covenant unto thee? yes certes wel and trewely quod he.  hastow nat had thy lady as thee lyketh? no no quod he and sorwefully he syketh.  what was the cause? tel me if thou can. aurelius his tale anon bigan and tolde him al as ye han herd bifore; it nedeth nat to yow reherce it more. he seide arveragus of gentillesse  had lever dye in sorwe and in distresse than that his wyf were of hir trouthe fals. the sorwe of dorigen he tolde him als  how looth hir was to been a wikked wyf and that she lever had lost that day hir lyf  and that hir trouthe she swoor thurgh innocence: she never erst herde speke of apparence; that made me han of hir so greet pitee. and right as frely as he sente hir me as frely sente i hir to him ageyn.  this al and som ther is namore to seyn. this philosophre answerde leve brother everich of yow dide gentilly til other.  thou art a squyer and he is a knight; but god forbede for his blisful might  butif a clerk coude doon a gentil dede as wel as any of yow it is no drede! sire i relesse thee thy thousand pound as thou right now were cropen out of the ground ne never er now ne haddest knowen me.  for sire i wol nat take a peny of thee for al my craft ne noght for my travaille. thou hast ypayed wel for my vitaille;  it is ynogh and farewel have good day: and took his hors and forth he gooth his way.  lordinges this question wolde i aske now  which was the moste free as thinketh yow? now telleth me er that ye ferther wende. i can namore my tale is at an ende.  here is ended the frankeleyns tale. the prologe of the seconde nonnes tale. the ministre and the norice unto vyces which that men clepe in english ydelnesse that porter of the gate is of delyces to eschue and by hir contrarie hir oppresse that is to seyn by leveful bisinesse  wel oghten we to doon al our entente lest that the feend thurgh ydelnesse us hente. for he that with his thousand cordes slye continuelly us waiteth to biclappe whan he may man in ydelnesse espye  he can so lightly cacche him in his trappe til that a man be hent right by the lappe he nis nat war the feend hath him in honde; wel oughte us werche and ydelnes withstonde. and though men dradden never for to dye  yet seen men wel by reson doutelees that ydelnesse is roten slogardye of which ther never comth no good encrees; and seen that slouthe hir holdeth in a lees only to slepe and for to ete and drinke  and to devouren al that othere swinke. and for to putte us fro swich ydelnesse that cause is of so greet confusioun i have heer doon my feithful bisinesse after the legende in translacioun  right of thy glorious lyf and passioun thou with thy gerland wroght of rose and lilie; thee mene i mayde and martir seint cecilie! inuocacio ad mariam. and thou that flour of virgines art alle of whom that bernard list so wel to wryte  to thee at my biginning first i calle; thou comfort of us wrecches do me endyte thy maydens deeth that wan thurgh hir meryte the eternal lyf and of the feend victorie as man may after reden in hir storie.  thou mayde and mooder doghter of thy sone thou welle of mercy sinful soules cure in whom that god for bountee chees to wone thou humble and heigh over every creature thou nobledest so ferforth our nature  that no desdeyn the maker hadde of kinde his sone in blode and flesh to clothe and winde. withinne the cloistre blisful of thy sydes took mannes shap the eternal love and pees that of the tryne compas lord and gyde is  whom erthe and see and heven out of relees ay herien; and thou virgin wemmelees bar of thy body and dweltest mayden pure the creatour of every creature. assembled is in thee magnificence  with mercy goodnesse and with swich pitee that thou that art the sonne of excellence nat only helpest hem that preyen thee but ofte tyme of thy benignitee ful frely er that men thyn help biseche  thou goost biforn and art hir lyves leche. now help thou meke and blisful fayre mayde me flemed wrecche in this desert of galle; think on the womman cananee that sayde that whelpes eten somme of the crommes alle  that from hir lordes table been yfalle; and though that i unworthy sone of eve be sinful yet accepte my bileve. and for that feith is deed withouten werkes so for to werken yif me wit and space  that i be quit fro thennes that most derk is! o thou that art so fayr and ful of grace be myn advocat in that heighe place theras withouten ende is songe osanne thou cristes mooder doghter dere of anne!  and of thy light my soule in prison lighte that troubled is by the contagioun of my body and also by the wighte of erthly luste and fals affeccioun; o haven of refut o salvacioun  of hem that been in sorwe and in distresse now help for to my werk i wol me dresse. yet preye i yow that reden that i wryte foryeve me that i do no diligence this ilke storie subtilly to endyte;  for both have i the wordes and sentence of him that at the seintes reverence the storie wroot and folwe hir legende and prey yow that ye wol my werk amende. interpretado nominis cecilie quam ponit frater iacobus ianuensis in legenda aurea. first wolde i yow the name of seint cecilie  expoune as men may in hir storie see it is to seye in english hevenes lilie for pure chastnesse of virginitee; or for she whytnesse hadde of honestee and grene of conscience and of good fame  the sole savour lilie was hir name. or cecile is to seye the wey to blinde for she ensample was by good techinge; or elles cecile as i writen finde is ioyned by a maner conioininge  of hevene and lia; and heer in figuringe the heven is set for thoght of holinesse and lia for hir lasting bisinesse. cecile may eek be seyd in this manere wanting of blindnesse for hir grete light  of sapience and for hir thewes clere; or elles lo! this maydens name bright of hevene and leos comth for which by right men mighte hir wel the heven of peple calle ensample of gode and wyse werkes alle.  for leos peple in english is to seye and right as men may in the hevene see the sonne and mone and sterres every weye right so men gostly in this mayden free seyen of feith the magnanimitee  and eek the cleernesse hool of sapience and sondry werkes brighte of excellence. and right so as thise philosophres wryte that heven is swift and round and eek brenninge right so was fayre cecilie the whyte  ful swift and bisy ever in good werkinge and round and hool in good perseveringe and brenning ever in charitee ful brighte; now have i yow declared what she highte. explicit. here biginneth the seconde nonnes tale of the lyf of seinte cecile. this mayden bright cecilie as hir lyf seith  was comen of romayns and of noble kinde and from hir cradel up fostred in the feith of crist and bar his gospel in hir minde; she never cessed as i writen finde of hir preyere and god to love and drede  biseking him to kepe hir maydenhede. and when this mayden sholde unto a man ywedded be that was ful yong of age which that ycleped was valerian and day was comen of hir mariage  she ful devout and humble in hir corage under hir robe of gold that sat ful fayre had next hir flesh yclad hir in an heyre. and whyl the organs maden melodye to god alone in herte thus sang she;  o lord my soule and eek my body gye unwemmed lest that i confounded be: and for his love that deyde upon a tree every seconde or thridde day she faste ay biddinge in hir orisons ful faste.  the night cam and to bedde moste she gon with hir housbonde as ofte is the manere and prively to him she seyde anon o swete and wel biloved spouse dere ther is a conseil and ye wolde it here  which that right fain i wolde unto yow seye so that ye swere ye shul me nat biwreye. valerian gan faste unto hir swere that for no cas ne thing that mighte be he sholde nevermo biwreyen here;  and thanne at erst to him thus seyde she i have an angel which that loveth me that with greet love wherso i wake or slepe is redy ay my body for to kepe. and if that he may felen out of drede  that ye me touche or love in vileinye he right anon wol slee yow with the dede and in your yowthe thus ye shulden dye; and if that ye in clene love me gye he wol yow loven as me for your clennesse  and shewen yow his ioye and his brightnesse. valerian corrected as god wolde answerde agayn if i shal trusten thee lat me that angel se and him biholde; and if that it a verray angel be  than wol i doon as thou hast preyed me; and if thou love another man for sothe right with this swerd than wol i slee yow bothe. cecile answerde anon right in this wyse if that yow list the angel shul ye see  so that ye trowe on crist and yow baptyse. goth forth to via apia quod she that fro this toun ne stant but myles three and to the povre folkes that ther dwelle sey hem right thus as that i shal yow telle.  telle hem that i cecile yow to hem sente to shewen yow the gode urban the olde for secree nedes and for good entente. and whan that ye seint urban han biholde telle him the wordes whiche i to yow tolde;  and whan that he hath purged yow fro sinne thanne shul ye see that angel er ye twinne. valerian is to the place ygon and right as him was taught by his lerninge he fond this holy olde urban anon  among the seintes buriels lotinge. and he anon withouten taryinge dide his message; and whan that he it tolde urban for ioye his hondes gan up holde. the teres from his yen leet he falle  almighty lord o iesu crist quod he sower of chast conseil herde of us alle the fruit of thilke seed of chastitee that thou hast sowe in cecile tak to thee! lo lyk a bisy bee withouten gyle  thee serveth ay thyn owene thral cecile! for thilke spouse that she took but now ful lyk a fiers leoun she sendeth here as meke as ever was any lamb to yow! and with that worde anon ther gan appere  an old man clad in whyte clothes clere that hadde a book with lettre of golde in honde and gan biforn valerian to stonde. valerian as deed fil doun for drede whan he him saugh and he up hente him tho  and on his book right thus he gan to rede oo lord oo feith oo god withouten mo oo cristendom and fader of alle also aboven alle and over al everywhere thise wordes al with gold ywriten were.  whan this was rad than seyde this olde man levestow this thing or no? sey ye or nay. i leve al this thing quod valerian for sother thing than this i dar wel say under the hevene no wight thinke may.  tho vanisshed the olde man he niste where and pope urban him cristened right there. valerian goth hoom and fint cecilie withinne his chambre with an angel stonde; this angel hadde of roses and of lilie  corones two the which he bar in honde; and first to cecile as i understonde he yaf that oon and after gan he take that other to valerian hir make. with body clene and with unwemmed thoght  kepeth ay wel thise corones quod he; fro paradys to yow have i hem broght ne nevermo ne shal they roten be ne lese her sote savour trusteth me; ne never wight shal seen hem with his ye  but he be chaast and hate vileinye. and thou valerian for thou so sone assentedest to good conseil also sey what thee list and thou shalt han thy bone. i have a brother quod valerian tho  that in this world i love no man so. i pray yow that my brother may han grace to knowe the trouthe as i do in this place. the angel seyde god lyketh thy requeste and bothe with the palm of martirdom  ye shullen come unto his blisful feste. and with that word tiburce his brother com. and whan that he the savour undernom which that the roses and the lilies caste withinne his herte he gan to wondre faste  and seyde i wondre this tyme of the yeer whennes that sote savour cometh so of rose and lilies that i smelle heer. for though i hadde hem in myn hondes two the savour mighte in me no depper go.  the sote smel that in myn herte i finde hath chaunged me al in another kinde. valerian seyde two corones han we snowwhyte and rosereed that shynen clere whiche that thyn yen han no might to see;  and as thou smellest hem thurgh my preyere so shaltow seen hem leve brother dere if it so be thou wolt withouten slouthe bileve aright and knowen verray trouthe. tiburce answerde seistow this to me  in soothnesse or in dreem i herkne this? in dremes quod valerian han we be unto this tyme brother myn ywis. but now at erst in trouthe our dwelling is. how woostow this quod tiburce in what wyse?  quod valerian that shal i thee devyse. the angel of god hath me the trouthe ytaught which thou shalt seen if that thou wolt reneye the ydoles and be clene and elles naught. and of the miracle of thise corones tweye  seint ambrose in his preface list to seye; solempnely this noble doctour dere commendeth it and seith in this manere: the palm of martirdom for to receyve seinte cecile fulfild of goddes yifte  the world and eek hir chambre gan she weyve; witnes tyburces and valerians shrifte to whiche god of his bountee wolde shifte corones two of floures wel smellinge and made his angel hem the corones bringe:  the mayde hath broght thise men to blisse above; the world hath wist what it is worth certeyn devocioun of chastitee to love. tho shewede him cecile al open and pleyn that alle ydoles nis but a thing in veyn;  for they been dombe and therto they been deve and charged him his ydoles for to leve. who so that troweth nat this a beste he is quod tho tiburce if that i shal nat lye. and she gan kisse his brest that herde this  and was ful glad he coude trouthe espye. this day i take thee for myn allye seyde this blisful fayre mayde dere; and after that she seyde as ye may here: lo right so as the love of crist quod she  made me thy brotheres wyf right in that wyse anon for myn allye heer take i thee sin that thou wolt thyn ydoles despyse. go with thy brother now and thee baptyse and make thee clene; so that thou mowe biholde  the angels face of which thy brother tolde. tiburce answerde and seyde brother dere first tel me whider i shal and to what man? to whom? quod he com forth with right good chere i wol thee lede unto the pope urban.  til urban? brother myn valerian quod tho tiburce woltow me thider lede? me thinketh that it were a wonder dede. ne menestow nat urban quod he tho that is so ofte dampned to be deed  and woneth in halkes alwey to and fro and dar nat ones putte forth his heed? men sholde him brennen in a fyr so reed if he were founde or that men mighte him spye; and we also to bere him companye  and whyl we seken thilke divinitee that is yhid in hevene prively algate ybrend in this world shul we be! to whom cecile answerde boldely men mighten dreden wel and skilfully  this lyf to lese myn owene dere brother if this were livinge only and non other. but ther is better lyf in other place that never shal be lost ne drede thee noght which goddes sone us tolde thurgh his grace;  that fadres sone hath alle thinges wroght; and al that wroght is with a skilful thoght the goost that fro the fader gan precede hath sowled hem withouten any drede. by word and by miracle goddes sone  whan he was in this world declared here that ther was other lyf ther men may wone. to whom answerde tiburce o suster dere ne seydestow right now in this manere ther nis but o god lord in soothfastnesse;  and now of three how maystow bere witnesse? that shal i telle quod she er i go. right as a man hath sapiences three memorie engyn and intellect also so in o being of divinitee  three persones may ther right wel be. tho gan she him ful bisily to preche of cristes come and of his peynes teche and many pointes of his passioun; how goddes sone in this world was withholde  to doon mankinde pleyn remissioun that was ybounde in sinne and cares colde: al this thing she unto tiburce tolde. and after this tiburce in good entente with valerian to pope urban he wente  that thanked god; and with glad herte and light he cristned him and made him in that place parfit in his lerninge goddes knight. and after this tiburce gat swich grace that every day he saugh in tyme and space  the angel of god; and every maner bone that he god axed it was sped ful sone. it were ful hard by ordre for to seyn how many wondres iesus for hem wroghte; but atte laste to tellen short and pleyn  the sergeants of the toun of rome hem soghte and hem biforn almache the prefect broghte which hem apposed and knew al hir entente and to the image of iupiter hem sente and seyde who so wol nat sacrifyse  swap of his heed this is my sentence here. anon thise martirs that i yow devyse oon maximus that was an officere of the prefectes and his corniculere hem hente; and whan he forth the seintes ladde  himself he weep for pitee that he hadde. whan maximus had herd the seintes lore he gat him of the tormentoures leve and ladde hem to his hous withoute more; and with hir preching er that it were eve  they gonnen fro the tormentours to reve and fro maxime and fro his folk echone the false feith to trowe in god allone. cecilie cam whan it was woxen night with preestes that hem cristned alle yfere;  and afterward whan day was woxen light cecile hem seyde with a ful sobre chere now cristes owene knightes leve and dere caste alle awey the werkes of derknesse and armeth yow in armure of brightnesse.  ye han for sothe ydoon a greet bataille your cours is doon your feith han ye conserved goth to the corone of lyf that may nat faille; the rightful iuge which that ye han served shall yeve it yow as ye han it deserved.  and whan this thing was seyd as i devyse men ladde hem forth to doon the sacrifyse. but whan they weren to the place broght to tellen shortly the conclusioun they nolde encense ne sacrifice right noght  but on hir knees they setten hem adoun with humble herte and sad devocioun and losten bothe hir hedes in the place. hir soules wenten to the king of grace. this maximus that saugh this thing bityde  with pitous teres tolde it anonright that he hir soules saugh to heven glyde with angels ful of cleernesse and of light and with his word converted many a wight; for which almachius dide him so tobete  with whippe of leed til he his lyf gan lete. cecile him took and buried him anoon by tiburce and valerian softely withinne hir buryingplace under the stoon. and after this almachius hastily  bad his ministres fecchen openly cecile so that she mighte in his presence doon sacrifyce and iupiter encense. but they converted at hir wyse lore wepten ful sore and yaven ful credence  unto hir word and cryden more and more crist goddes sone withouten difference is verray god this is al our sentence that hath so good a servant him to serve; this with o voys we trowen thogh we sterve!  almachius that herde of this doinge bad fecchen cecile that he might hir see and alderfirst lo! this was his axinge what maner womman artow? tho quod he. i am a gentil womman born quod she.  i axe thee quod he thogh it thee greve of thy religioun and of thy bileve. ye han bigonne your question folily quod she that wolden two answeres conclude in oo demande; ye axed lewedly.  almache answerde unto that similitude of whennes comth thyn answering so rude? of whennes? quod she whan that she was freyned of conscience and of good feith unfeyned. almachius seyde ne takestow non hede  of my power? and she answerde him this your might quod she ful litel is to drede; for every mortal mannes power nis but lyk a bladdre ful of wind ywis. for with a nedles poynt whan it is blowe  may al the boost of it be leyd ful lowe. ful wrongfully bigonne thou quod he and yet in wrong is thy perseveraunce; wostow nat how our mighty princes free han thus comanded and maad ordinaunce  that every cristen wight shal han penaunce butif that he his cristendom withseye and goon al quit if he wol it reneye? your princes erren as your nobley dooth quod tho cecile and with a wood sentence  ye make us gilty and it is nat sooth; for ye that knowen wel our innocence for as muche as we doon a reverence to crist and for we bere a cristen name ye putte on us a cryme and eek a blame.  but we that knowen thilke name so for vertuous we may it nat withseye. almache answerde chees oon of thise two do sacrifyce or cristendom reneye that thou mowe now escapen by that weye.  at which the holy blisful fayre mayde gan for to laughe and to the iuge seyde o iuge confus in thy nycetee woltow that i reneye innocence to make me a wikked wight? quod she;  lo! he dissimuleth here in audience he stareth and woodeth in his advertence! to whom almachius unsely wrecche ne woostow nat how far my might may strecche? han noght our mighty princes to me yeven  ye bothe power and auctoritee to maken folk to dyen or to liven? why spekestow so proudly than to me? i speke noght but stedfastly quod she nat proudly for i seye as for my syde  we haten deedly thilke vyce of pryde. and if thou drede nat a sooth to here than wol i shewe al openly by right that thou hast maad a ful gret lesing here. thou seyst thy princes han thee yeven might  bothe for to sleen and for to quiken a wight; thou that ne mayst but only lyf bireve thou hast non other power ne no leve! but thou mayst seyn thy princes han thee maked ministre of deeth; for if thou speke of mo  thou lyest for thy power is ful naked. do wey thy boldnes seyde almachius tho and sacrifyce to our goddes er thou go; i recche nat what wrong that thou me profre for i can suffre it as a philosophre;  but thilke wronges may i nat endure that thou spekest of our goddes here quod he. cecile answerede o nyce creature thou seydest no word sin thou spak to me that i ne knew therwith thy nycetee;  and that thou were in every maner wyse a lewed officer and a veyn iustyse. ther lakketh nothing to thyn utter yen that thou nart blind for thing that we seen alle that it is stoon that men may wel espyen  that ilke stoon a god thou wolt it calle. i rede thee lat thyn hand upon it falle and taste it wel and stoon thou shalt it finde sin that thou seest nat with thyn yen blinde. it is a shame that the peple shal  so scorne thee and laughe at thy folye; for comunly men woot it wel overal that mighty god is in his hevenes hye and thise images wel thou mayst espye to thee ne to hemself mowe nought profyte  for in effect they been nat worth a myte. thise wordes and swiche othere seyde she and he weex wroth and bad men sholde hir lede hom til hir hous and in hir hous quod he brenne hir right in a bath of flambes rede.  and as he bad right so was doon in dede; for in a bath they gonne hir faste shetten and night and day greet fyr they under betten. the longe night and eek a day also for al the fyr and eek the bathes hete  she sat al cold and felede no wo it made hir nat a drope for to swete. but in that bath hir lyf she moste lete; for he almachius with ful wikke entente to sleen hir in the bath his sonde sente.  three strokes in the nekke he smoot hir tho the tormentour but for no maner chaunce he mighte noght smyte al hir nekke atwo; and for ther was that tyme an ordinaunce that no man sholde doon man swich penaunce  the ferthe strook to smyten softe or sore this tormentour ne dorste do namore. but halfdeed with hir nekke ycorven there he lefte hir lye and on his wey is went. the cristen folk which that aboute hir were  with shetes han the blood ful faire yhent. thre dayes lived she in this torment and never cessed hem the feith to teche; that she hadde fostred hem she gan to preche; and hem she yaf hir moebles and hir thing  and to the pope urban bitook hem tho and seyde i axed this at hevene king to han respyt three dayes and namo to recomende to yow er that i go thise soules lo! and that i mighte do werche  here of myn hous perpetuelly a cherche. seint urban with his deknes prively the body fette and buried it by nighte among his othere seintes honestly. hir hous the chirche of seint cecilie highte;  seint urban halwed it as he wel mighte; in which into this day in noble wyse men doon to crist and to his seint servyse. here is ended the seconde nonnes tale. the prologe of the chanons yemannes tale. whan ended was the lyf of seint cecyle er we had riden fully fyve myle  at boghton under blee us gan atake a man that clothed was in clothes blake and undernethe he hadde a whyt surplys. his hakeney that was al pomely grys so swatte that it wonder was to see;  it semed he had priked myles three. the hors eek that his yeman rood upon so swatte that unnethe mighte it gon.  aboute the peytrel stood the foom ful hye he was of fome al flekked as a pye.  a male tweyfold on his croper lay it semed that he caried lyte array. al light for somer rood this worthy man and in myn herte wondren i bigan what that he was til that i understood  how that his cloke was sowed to his hood; for which when i had longe avysed me i demed him som chanon for to be.  his hat heng at his bak doun by a laas for he had riden more than trot or paas;  he had ay priked lyk as he were wood. a cloteleef he hadde under his hood for swoot and for to kepe his heed from hete. but it was ioye for to seen him swete! his forheed dropped as a stillatorie  were ful of plantain and of paritorie. and whan that he was come he gan to crye god save quod he this ioly companye!  faste have i priked quod he for your sake bycause that i wolde yow atake  to ryden in this mery companye. his yeman eek was ful of curteisye and seyde sires now in the morwetyde out of your hostelrye i saugh you ryde and warned heer my lord and my soverayn  which that to ryden with yow is ful fayn for his desport; he loveth daliaunce. freend for thy warning god yeve thee good chaunce than seyde our host for certes it wolde seme  thy lord were wys and so i may wel deme;  he is ful iocund also dar i leye. can he oght telle a mery tale or tweye with which he glade may this companye? who sire? my lord? ye ye withouten lye he can of murthe and eek of iolitee  nat but ynough; also sir trusteth me and ye him knewe as wel as do i ye wolde wondre how wel and craftily  he coude werke and that in sondry wyse. he hath take on him many a greet empryse  which were ful hard for any that is here to bringe aboute but they of him it lere. as homely as he rit amonges yow if ye him knewe it wolde be for your prow; ye wolde nat forgoon his aqueyntaunce  for mochel good i dar leye in balaunce al that i have in my possessioun. he is a man of heigh discrecioun  i warne you wel he is a passing man. wel quod our host i pray thee tel me than  is he a clerk or noon? tel what he is. nay he is gretter than a clerk ywis seyde this yeman and in wordes fewe host of his craft somwhat i wol yow shewe. i seye my lord can swich subtilitee  but al his craft ye may nat wite at me; and somwhat helpe i yet to his werking that al this ground on which we been ryding  til that we come to caunterbury toun he coude al clene turne it upsodoun  and pave it al of silver and of gold. and whan this yeman hadde thus ytold unto our host he seyde benedicite! this thing is wonder merveillous to me sin that thy lord is of so heigh prudence  bycause of which men sholde him reverence that of his worship rekketh he so lyte; his oversloppe nis nat worth a myte  as in effect to him so mote i go! it is al baudy and totore also.  why is thy lord so sluttish i thee preye and is of power better cloth to beye if that his dede accorde with thy speche? telle me that and that i thee biseche. why? quod this yeman wherto axe ye me?  god help me so for he shal never thee! but i wol nat avowe that i seye and therfor kepe it secree i yow preye.  he is to wys in feith as i bileve; that that is overdoon it wol nat preve  aright as clerkes seyn it is a vyce. wherfor in that i holde him lewed and nyce. for whan a man hath overgreet a wit ful oft him happeth to misusen it; so dooth my lord and that me greveth sore.  god it amende i can sey yow namore. therof no fors good yeman quod our host; sin of the conning of thy lord thou wost  tel how he dooth i pray thee hertely sin that he is so crafty and so sly.  wher dwellen ye if it to telle be? in the suburbes of a toun quod he lurkinge in hernes and in lanes blinde wheras thise robbours and thise theves by kinde holden hir privee fereful residence  as they that dar nat shewen hir presence; so faren we if i shal seye the sothe. now quod our host yit lat me talke to the;  why artow so discoloured of thy face? peter! quod he god yeve it harde grace  i am so used in the fyr to blowe that it hath chaunged my colour i trowe. i am nat wont in no mirour to prye but swinke sore and lerne multiplye. we blondren ever and pouren in the fyr  and for al that we fayle of our desyr for ever we lakken our conclusioun. to mochel folk we doon illusioun  and borwe gold be it a pound or two or ten or twelve or many sommes mo  and make hem wenen at the leeste weye that of a pound we coude make tweye! yet is it fals but ay we han good hope it for to doon and after it we grope. but that science is so fer us biforn  we mowen nat although we hadde it sworn it overtake it slit awey so faste; it wol us maken beggers atte laste.  whyl this yeman was thus in his talking this chanoun drough him neer and herde al thing  which this yeman spak for suspecioun of mennes speche ever hadde this chanoun. for catoun seith that he that gilty is demeth al thing be spoke of him ywis. that was the cause he gan so ny him drawe  to his yeman to herknen al his sawe. and thus he seyde unto his yeman tho hold thou thy pees and spek no wordes mo  for if thou do thou shalt it dere abye; thou sclaundrest me heer in this companye  and eek discoverest that thou sholdest hyde. ye quod our host telle on what so bityde; of al his threting rekke nat a myte! in feith quod he namore i do but lyte. and whan this chanon saugh it wolde nat be  but his yeman wolde telle his privetee he fledde awey for verray sorwe and shame. a! quod the yeman heer shal aryse game  al that i can anon now wol i telle. sin he is goon the foule feend him quelle!  for never herafter wol i with him mete for peny ne for pound i yow bihete! he that me broghte first unto that game er that he dye sorwe have he and shame! for it is ernest to me by my feith;  that fele i wel what so any man seith. and yet for al my smert and al my grief for al my sorwe labour and meschief  i coude never leve it in no wyse. now wolde god my wit mighte suffyse  to tellen al that longeth to that art! but natheles yow wol i tellen part; sin that my lord is gon i wol nat spare; swich thing as that i knowe i wol declare.  here endeth the prologe of the chanouns yemannes tale. here biginneth the chanouns yeman his tale. prima pars. with this chanoun i dwelt have seven yeer  and of his science am i never the neer. al that i hadde i have ylost therby; and god wot so hath many mo than i.  ther i was wont to be right fresh and gay of clothing and of other good array  now may i were an hose upon myn heed; and wher my colour was bothe fresh and reed now is it wan and of a leden hewe; whoso it useth sore shal he rewe. and of my swink yet blered is myn ye  lo! which avantage is to multiplye! that slyding science hath me maad so bare that i have no good wher that ever i fare;  and yet i am endetted so therby of gold that i have borwed trewely  that whyl i live i shal it quyte never. lat every man be war by me for ever! what maner man that casteth him therto if he continue i holde his thrift ydo. so helpe me god therby shal he nat winne  but empte his purs and make his wittes thinne. and whan he thurgh his madnes and folye hath lost his owene good thurgh iupartye  thanne he excyteth other folk therto to lese hir good as he himself hath do.  for unto shrewes ioye it is and ese to have hir felawes in peyne and disese; thus was i ones lerned of a clerk. of that no charge i wol speke of our werk. whan we been ther as we shul exercyse  our elvish craft we semen wonder wyse our termes been so clergial and so queynte. i blowe the fyr til that myn herte feynte.  what sholde i tellen ech proporcioun of thinges whiche that we werche upon  as on fyve or sixe ounces may wel be of silver or som other quantite and bisie me to telle yow the names of orpiment brent bones yren squames that into poudre grounden been ful smal?  and in an erthen potte how put is al and salt yput in and also papeer biforn thise poudres that i speke of heer  and wel ycovered with a lampe of glas and mochel other thing which that ther was?  and of the pot and glasses enluting that of the eyre mighte passe out nothing? and of the esy fyr and smart also which that was maad and of the care and wo that we hadde in our matires sublyming  and in amalgaming and calcening of quiksilver yclept mercurie crude? for alle our sleightes we can nat conclude.  our orpiment and sublymed mercurie our grounden litarge eek on the porphurie  of ech of thise of ounces a certeyn nought helpeth us our labour is in veyn. ne eek our spirites ascencioun ne our materes that lyen al fixe adoun mowe in our werking nothing us avayle.  for lost is al our labour and travayle and al the cost a twenty devel weye is lost also which we upon it leye.  ther is also ful many another thing that is unto our craft apertening;  though i by ordre hem nat reherce can bycause that i am a lewed man yet wol i telle hem as they come to minde though i ne can nat sette hem in hir kinde; as bole armoniak verdegrees boras  and sondry vessels maad of erthe and glas our urinales and our descensories violes croslets and sublymatories  cucurbites and alembykes eek and othere swiche dere ynough a leek.  nat nedeth it for to reherce hem alle watres rubifying and boles galle arsenik sal armoniak and brimstoon;

for al the good he spendeth theraboute he lese shal therof have i no doute.  whoso that listeth outen his folye lat him come forth and lerne multiplye;  and every man that oght hath in his cofre lat him appere and wexe a philosofre. ascaunce that craft is so light to lere? nay nay god woot al be he monk or frere preest or chanoun or any other wight  though he sitte at his book bothe day and night in lernyng of this elvish nyce lore al is in veyn and parde mochel more!  to lerne a lewed man this subtiltee fy! spek nat therof for it wol nat be;  al conne he letterure or conne he noon as in effect he shal finde it al oon. for bothe two by my savacioun concluden in multiplicacioun ylyke wel whan they han al ydo;  this is to seyn they faylen bothe two. yet forgat i to maken rehersaille of watres corosif and of limaille  and of bodyes mollificacioun and also of hir induracioun  oiles ablucions and metal fusible to tellen al wolde passen any bible that owher is; wherfor as for the beste of alle thise names now wol i me reste. for as i trowe i have yow told ynowe  to reyse a feend al loke he never so rowe. a! nay! lat be; the philosophres stoon elixir clept we sechen faste echoon;  for hadde we him than were we siker ynow. but unto god of heven i make avow  for al our craft whan we han al ydo and al our sleighte he wol nat come us to. he hath ymaad us spenden mochel good for sorwe of which almost we wexen wood but that good hope crepeth in our herte  supposinge ever though we sore smerte to be releved by him afterward; swich supposing and hope is sharp and hard;  i warne yow wel it is to seken ever; that futur temps hath maad men to dissever  in trust therof from al that ever they hadde. yet of that art they can nat wexen sadde for unto hem it is a bitter swete; so semeth it; for nadde they but a shete which that they mighte wrappe hem inne anight  and a bak to walken inne by daylight they wolde hem selle and spenden on this craft; they can nat stinte til nothing be laft.  and evermore wher that ever they goon men may hem knowe by smel of brimstoon;  for al the world they stinken as a goot; her savour is so rammish and so hoot that though a man from hem a myle be the savour wol infecte him trusteth me; lo thus by smelling and threedbare array  if that men liste this folk they knowe may. and if a man wol aske hem prively why they been clothed so unthriftily  they right anon wol rownen in his ere and seyn that if that they espyed were  men wolde hem slee bycause of hir science; lo thus this folk bitrayen innocence! passe over this; i go my tale unto. er than the pot be on the fyr ydo of metals with a certein quantite  my lord hem tempreth and no man but he now he is goon i dar seyn boldely for as men seyn he can don craftily;  algate i wool wel he hath swich a name and yet ful ofte he renneth in a blame;  and wite ye how? ful ofte it happeth so the pot tobreketh and farewel! al is go! thise metals been of so greet violence our walles mowe nat make hem resistence but if they weren wroght of lym and stoon;  they percen so and thurgh the wal they goon and somme of hem sinken into the ground thus han we lost by tymes many a pound  and somme are scatered al the floor aboute somme lepe into the roof; withouten doute  though that the feend noght in our sighte him shewe i trowe he with us be that ilke shrewe! in helle wher that he is lord and sire nis ther more wo ne more rancour ne ire. whan that our pot is broke as i have sayd  every man chit and halt him yvel apayd. som seyde it was long on the fyrmaking som seyde nay! it was on the blowing;  than was i fered for that was myn office; straw! quod the thridde ye been lewed and nyce  it was nat tempred as it oghte be. nay! quod the ferthe stint and herkne me; bycause our fyr ne was nat maad of beech that is the cause and other noon so theech! i can nat telle wheron it was long  but wel i wot greet stryf is us among. what! quod my lord ther is namore to done of thise perils i wol be war eftsone;  i am right siker that the pot was crased. be as be may be ye nothing amased;  as usage is lat swepe the floor as swythe plukke up your hertes and beth gladde and blythe. the mullok on an hepe ysweped was and on the floor ycast a canevas and al this mullok in a sive ythrowe  and sifted and ypiked many a throwe. pardee quod oon somwhat of our metal yet is ther heer though that we han nat al.  although this thing mishapped have as now another tyme it may be wel ynow  us moste putte our good in aventure; a marchant parde! may nat ay endure trusteth me wel in his prosperitee; somtyme his good is drenched in the see and somtym comth it sauf unto the londe.  pees! quod my lord the next tyme i wol fonde to bringe our craft al in another plyte; and but i do sirs lat me han the wyte;  ther was defaute in somwhat wel i woot. another seyde the fyr was over hoot:  but be it hoot or cold i dar seye this that we concluden evermore amis. we fayle of that which that we wolden have and in our madnesse evermore we rave. and whan we been togidres everichoon  every man semeth a salomon. but al thing which that shyneth as the gold nis nat gold as that i have herd it told;  ne every appel that is fair at ye ne is nat good whatso men clappe or crye.  right so lo! fareth it amonges us; he that semeth the wysest by iesus! is most fool whan it cometh to the preef; and he that semeth trewest is a theef; that shul ye knowe er that i fro yow wende  by that i of my tale have maad an ende. explicit prima pars. et sequitur pars secunda. ther is a chanoun of religioun amonges us wolde infecte al a toun  though it as greet were as was ninivee rome alisaundre troye and othere three.  his sleightes and his infinit falsnesse ther coude no man wryten as i gesse thogh that he mighte liven a thousand yeer. in al this world of falshede nis his peer; for in his termes so he wolde him winde  and speke his wordes in so sly a kinde whan he commune shal with any wight that he wol make him doten anon right  but it a feend be as himselven is. ful many a man hath he bigyled er this  and wol if that he live may a whyle; and yet men ryde and goon ful many a myle him for to seke and have his aqueyntaunce noght knowinge of his false governaunce. and if yow list to yeve me audience  i wol it tellen heer in your presence. but worshipful chanouns religious ne demeth nat that i sclaundre your hous  although my tale of a chanoun be. of every ordre som shrewe is parde  and god forbede that al a companye sholde rewe a singuler mannes folye. to sclaundre yow is nothing myn entente but to correcten that is mis i mente. this tale was nat only told for yow  but eek for othere mo; ye woot wel how that among cristes apostelles twelve ther nas no traytour but iudas himselve.  than why sholde al the remenant have blame that giltlees were? by yow i seye the same.  save only this if ye wol herkne me if any iudas in your covent be remeveth him bitymes i yow rede if shame or los may causen any drede. and beth nothing displesed i yow preye  but in this cas herkneth what i shal seye. in london was a preest an annueleer that therin dwelled hadde many a yeer  which was so plesaunt and so servisable unto the wyf wheras he was at table  that she wolde suffre him nothing for to paye for bord ne clothing wente he never so gaye; and spendingsilver hadde he right ynow. therof no fors; i wol precede as now and telle forth my tale of the chanoun  that broghte this preest to confusioun. this false chanoun cam upon a day unto this preestes chambre wher he lay  biseching him to lene him a certeyn of gold and he wolde quyte it him ageyn.  lene me a mark quod he but dayes three and at my day i wol it quyten thee. and if so be that thou me finde fals another day do hange me by the hals! this preest him took a mark and that as swythe  and this chanoun him thanked ofte sythe and took his leve and wente forth his weye and at the thridde day broghte his moneye  and to the preest he took his gold agayn wherof this preest was wonder glad and fayn.  certes quod he nothing anoyeth me to lene a man a noble or two or three or what thing were in my possessioun whan he so trewe is of condicioun that in no wyse he breke wol his day;  to swich a man i can never seye nay. what! quod this chanoun sholde i be untrewe? nay that were thing yfallen al ofnewe.  trouthe is a thing that i wol ever kepe unto that day in which that i shal crepe  into my grave and elles god forbede; bileveth this as siker as is your crede. god thanke i and in good tyme be it sayd that ther was never man yet yvel apayd for gold ne silver that he to me lente  ne never falshede in myn herte i mente. and sir quod he now of my privetee sin ye so goodlich han been unto me  and kythed to me so greet gentillesse somwhat to quyte with your kindenesse  i wol yow shewe and if yow list to lere i wol yow teche pleynly the manere how i can werken in philosophye. taketh good heed ye shul wel seen at ye that i wol doon a maistrie er i go.  ye quod the preest ye sir and wol ye so? marie! therof i pray yow hertely! at your comandement sir trewely  quod the chanoun and elles god forbede! lo how this theef coude his servyse bede!  ful sooth it is that swich profred servyse stinketh as witnessen thise olde wyse; and that ful sone i wol it verifye in this chanoun rote of al trecherye that evermore delyt hath and gladnesse  swich feendly thoughtes in his herte impresse how cristes peple he may to meschief bringe; god kepe us from his fals dissimulinge!  noght wiste this preest with whom that he delte ne of his harm cominge he nothing felte.  o sely preest! o sely innocent! with coveityse anon thou shall be blent! o gracelees ful blind is thy conceit nothing ne artow war of the deceit which that this fox yshapen hath to thee!  his wyly wrenches thou ne mayst nat flee. wherfor to go to the conclusioun that refereth to thy confusioun  unhappy man! anon i wol me hye to tellen thyn unwit and thy folye  and eek the falsnesse of that other wrecche as ferforth as that my conning may strecche. this chanoun was my lord ye wolden wene? sir host in feith and by the hevenes quene it was another chanoun and nat he  that can an hundred fold more subtiltee! he hath bitrayed folkes many tyme; of his falshede it dulleth me to ryme.  ever whan that i speke of his falshede for shame of him my chekes wexen rede;  algates they biginnen for to glowe for reednesse have i noon right wel i knowe in my visage; for fumes dyverse of metals which ye han herd me reherce consumed and wasted han my reednesse.  now tak heed of this chanouns cursednesse! sir quod he to the preest lat your man gon for quiksilver that we it hadde anon;  and lat him bringen ounces two or three; and whan he comth as faste shul ye see  a wonder thing which ye saugh never er this. sir quod the preest it shal be doon ywis. he bad his servant fecchen him this thing and he al redy was at his bidding and wente him forth and cam anon agayn  with this quiksilver soothly for to sayn and took thise ounces three to the chanoun; and he hem leyde fayre and wel adoun  and bad the servant coles for to bringe that he anon mighte go to his werkinge.  the coles right anon weren yfet and this chanoun took out a crosselet of his bosom and shewed it the preest. this instrument quod he which that thou seest tak in thyn hand and put thyself therinne  of this quiksilver an ounce and heer biginne in the name of crist to wexe a philosofre. ther been ful fewe whiche that i wolde profre  to shewen hem thus muche of my science. for ye shul seen heer by experience  that this quiksilver wol i mortifye right in your sighte anon withouten lye and make it as good silver and as fyn as ther is any in your purs or myn or elleswher and make it malliable;  and elles holdeth me fals and unable amonges folk for ever to appere! i have a poudre heer that coste me dere  shal make al good for it is cause of al my conning which that i yow shewen shal.  voydeth your man and lat him be theroute and shet the dore whyls we been aboute our privetee that no man us espye whyls that we werke in this philosophye. al as he bad fulfilled was in dede  this ilke servant anonright out yede and his maister shette the dore anon and to hir labour speedily they gon.  this preest at this cursed chanouns bidding upon the fyr anon sette this thing  and blew the fyr and bisied him ful faste; and this chanoun into the croslet caste a poudre noot i wherof that it was ymaad other of chalk other of glas or somwhat elles was nat worth a flye  to blynde with the preest; and bad him hye the coles for to couchen al above the croslet for in tokening i thee love  quod this chanoun thyn owene hondes two shul werche al thing which that shal heer be do.  graunt mercy quod the preest and was ful glad and couched coles as the chanoun bad. and whyle he bisy was this feendly wrecche this fals chanoun the foule feend him fecche! out of his bosom took a bechen cole  in which ful subtilly was maad an hole and therin put was of silver lymaille an ounce and stopped was withouten fayle  the hole with wex to kepe the lymail in. and understondeth that this false gin  was nat maad ther but it was maad bifore; and othere thinges i shal telle more herafterward which that he with him broghte; er he cam ther him to bigyle he thoghte and so he dide er that they wente atwinne;  til he had terved him coude he not blinne. it dulleth me whan that i of him speke on his falshede fayn wolde i me wreke  if i wiste how; but he is heer and ther: he is so variaunt he abit nowher.  but taketh heed now sirs for goddes love! he took his cole of which i spak above and in his hond he baar it prively. and whyls the preest couchede busily the coles as i tolde yow er this  this chanoun seyde freend ye doon amis; this is nat couched as it oghte be; but sone i shal amenden it quod he.  now lat me medle therwith but a whyle for of yow have i pitee by seint gyle!  ye been right hoot i see wel how ye swete have heer a cloth and wype awey the wete. and whyles that the preest wyped his face this chanoun took his cole with harde grace and leyde it above upon the middeward  of the croslet and blew wel afterward til that the coles gonne faste brenne. now yeve us drinke quod the chanoun thenne  as swythe al shal be wel i undertake; sitte we doun and lat us mery make.  and whan that this chanounes bechen cole was brent al the lymaille out of the hole into the croslet fil anon adoun; and so it moste nedes by resoun sin it so even aboven couched was;  but therof wiste the preest nothing alas! he demed alle the coles yliche good for of the sleighte he nothing understood.  and whan this alkamistre saugh his tyme rys up quod he sir preest and stondeth by me;  and for i woot wel ingot have ye noon goth walketh forth and bring us a chalkstoon; for i wol make oon of the same shap that is an ingot if i may han hap. and bringeth eek with yow a bolle or a panne  ful of water and ye shul see wel thanne how that our bisinesse shal thryve and preve. and yet for ye shul han no misbileve  ne wrong conceit of me in your absence i ne wol nat been out of your presence  but go with yow and come with yow ageyn. the chambredore shortly for to seyn they opened and shette and wente hir weye. and forth with hem they carieden the keye and come agayn withouten any delay.  what sholde i tarien al the longe day? he took the chalk and shoop it in the wyse of an ingot as i shal yow devyse.  i seye he took out of his owene sleve a teyne of silver yvele mote he cheve!  which that ne was nat but an ounce of weighte; and taketh heed now of his cursed sleighte! he shoop his ingot in lengthe and eek in brede of this teyne withouten any drede so slyly that the preest it nat espyde;  and in his sleve agayn he gan it hyde; and fro the fyr he took up his matere and in thingot putte it with mery chere  and in the watervessel he it caste whan that him luste and bad the preest as faste  look what ther is put in thyn hand and grope thow finde shalt ther silver as i hope; what devel of helle! sholde it elles be? shaving of silver silver is pardee! he putte his hond in and took up a teyne  of silver fyn and glad in every veyne was this preest whan he saugh that it was so. goddes blessing and his modres also  and alle halwes have ye sir chanoun seyde this preest and i hir malisoun  but and ye vouchesauf to techen me this noble craft and this subtilitee i wol be youre in al that ever i may! quod the chanoun yet wol i make assay the second tyme that ye may taken hede  and been expert of this and in your nede another day assaye in myn absence this disciplyne and this crafty science.  lat take another ounce quod he tho of quiksilver withouten wordes mo  and do therwith as ye han doon er this with that other which that now silver is. this preest him bisieth in al that he can to doon as this chanoun this cursed man comanded him and faste he blew the fyr  for to come to theffect of his desyr. and this chanoun right in the mene whyle al redy was the preest eft to bigyle  and for a countenance in his hande he bar an holwe stikke tak keep and be war!  in the ende of which an ounce and namore of silver lymail put was as bifore was in his cole and stopped with wex weel for to kepe in his lymail every deel. and whyl this preest was in his bisinesse  this chanoun with his stikke gan him dresse to him anon and his pouder caste in as he did er; the devel out of his skin  him terve i pray to god for his falshede; for he was ever fals in thoght and dede;  and with this stikke above the croslet that was ordeyned with that false get he stired the coles til relente gan the wex agayn the fyr as every man but it a fool be woot wel it mot nede  and al that in the stikke was out yede and in the croslet hastily it fel. now gode sirs what wol ye bet than wel?  whan that this preest thus was bigyled ageyn supposing noght but trouthe soth to seyn  he was so glad that i can nat expresse in no manere his mirthe and his gladnesse; and to the chanoun he profred eftsone body and good; ye quod the chanoun sone though povre i be crafty thou shalt me finde;  i warne thee yet is ther more bihinde. is ther any coper herinne? seyde he. ye quod the preest sir i trowe wel ther be.  elles go by us som and that as swythe now gode sir go forth thy wey and hy the.  he wente his wey and with the coper cam and this chanoun it in his handes nam and of that coper weyed out but an ounce. al to simple is my tonge to pronounce as ministre of my wit the doublenesse  of this chanoun rote of al cursednesse. he semed freendly to hem that knewe him noght but he was feendly bothe in herte and thoght.  it werieth me to telle of his falsnesse and nathelees yet wol i it expresse  to thentente that men may be war therby and for noon other cause trewely. he putte his ounce of coper in the croslet and on the fyr as swythe he hath it set and caste in poudre and made the preest to blowe  and in his werking for to stoupe lowe as he dide er and al nas but a iape; right as him liste the preest he made his ape;  and afterward in the ingot he it caste and in the panne putte it at the laste  of water and in he putte his owene hond. and in his sleve as ye bifornhond herde me telle he hadde a silver teyne. he slyly took it out this cursed heyne unwiting this preest of his false craft  and in the pannes botme he hath it laft; and in the water rombled to and fro and wonder prively took up also  the coper teyne noght knowing this preest and hidde it and him hente by the breest  and to him spak and thus seyde in his game stoupeth adoun by god ye be to blame helpeth me now as i dide yow whyler putte in your hand and loketh what is ther. this preest took up this silver teyne anon  and thanne seyde the chanoun lat us gon with thise three teynes which that we han wroght to som goldsmith and wite if they been oght.  for by my feith i nolde for myn hood butif that they were silver fyn and good  and that as swythe preved shal it be. unto the goldsmith with thise teynes three they wente and putte thise teynes in assay to fyr and hamer; mighte no man sey nay but that they weren as hem oghte be.  this sotted preest who was gladder than he? was never brid gladder agayn the day ne nightingale in the sesoun of may  nas never noon that luste bet to singe; ne lady lustier in carolinge  or for to speke of love and wommanhede ne knight in armes to doon an hardy dede to stonde in grace of his lady dere than had this preest this sory craft to lere; and to the chanoun thus he spak and seyde  for love of god that for us alle deyde and as i may deserve it unto yow what shal this receit coste? telleth now!  by our lady quod this chanoun it is dere i warne yow wel; for save i and a frere  in engelond ther can no man it make. no fors quod he now sir for goddes sake what shal i paye? telleth me i preye. ywis quod he it is ful dere i seye; sir at o word if that thee list it have  ye shul paye fourty pound so god me save! and nere the freendship that ye dide er this to me ye sholde paye more ywis.  this preest the somme of fourty pound anon of nobles fette and took hem everichon  to this chanoun for this ilke receit; al his werking nas but fraude and deceit. sir preest he seyde i kepe han no loos of my craft for i wolde it kept were cloos; and as ye love me kepeth it secree;  for and men knewe al my subtilitee by god they wolden han so greet envye to me bycause of my philosophye  i sholde be deed ther were non other weye. god it forbede! quod the preest what sey ye?  yet hadde i lever spenden al the good which that i have and elles wexe i wood! than that ye sholden falle in swich mescheef. for your good wil sir have ye right good preef quod the chanoun and farwel grant mercy!  he wente his wey and never the preest him sy after that day; and whan that this preest sholde maken assay at swich tyme as he wolde  of this receit farwel! it wolde nat be! lo thus byiaped and bigyled was he!  thus maketh he his introduccioun to bringe folk to hir destruccioun. considereth sirs how that in ech estaat bitwixe men and gold ther is debaat so ferforth that unnethes is ther noon.  this multiplying blent so many oon that in good feith i trowe that it be the cause grettest of swich scarsetee.  philosophres speken so mistily in this craft that men can nat come therby  for any wit that men han now adayes. they mowe wel chiteren as doon thise iayes and in her termes sette hir lust and peyne but to hir purpos shul they never atteyne. a man may lightly lerne if he have aught  to multiplye and bringe his good to naught! lo! swich a lucre is in this lusty game a mannes mirthe it wol torne unto grame  and empten also grete and hevy purses and maken folk for to purchasen curses  of hem that han hir good therto ylent. o! fy! for shame! they that han been brent allas! can they nat flee the fyres hete? ye that it use i rede ye it lete lest ye lese al; for bet than never is late.  never to thryve were to long a date. though ye prolle ay ye shul it never finde; ye been as bolde as is bayard the blinde  that blundreth forth and peril casteth noon; he is as bold to renne agayn a stoon  as for to goon besydes in the weye. so faren ye that multiplye i seye. if that your yen can nat seen aright loke that your minde lakke nought his sight. for though ye loke never so brode and stare  ye shul nat winne a myte on that chaffare but wasten al that ye may rape and renne. withdrawe the fyr lest it to faste brenne;  medleth namore with that art i mene for if ye doon your thrift is goon ful clene.  and right as swythe i wol yow tellen here what philosophres seyn in this matere. lo thus seith arnold of the newe toun as his rosarie maketh mencioun; he seith right thus withouten any lye  ther may no man mercurie mortifye but it be with his brother knowleching. how that he which that first seyde this thing  of philosophres fader was hermes; he seith how that the dragoun doutelees  ne deyeth nat butif that he be slayn with his brother; and that is for to sayn by the dragoun mercurie and noon other he understood; and brimstoon by his brother that out of sol and luna were ydrawe.  and therfor seyde he tak heed to my sawe let no man bisy him this art for to seche butif that he thentencioun and speche  of philosophres understonde can; and if he do he is a lewed man.  for this science and this conning quod he is of the secree of secrees parde. also ther was a disciple of plato that on a tyme seyde his maister to as his book senior wol bere witnesse  and this was his demande in soothfastnesse: tel me the name of the privy stoon? and plato answerde unto him anoon  tak the stoon that titanos men name. which is that? quod he. magnesia is the same  seyde plato. ye sir and is it thus? this is ignotum per ignotius. what is magnesia good sir i yow preye? it is a water that is maad i seye of elementes foure quod plato.  tel me the rote good sir quod he tho of that water if that it be your wille? nay nay quod plato certein that i nille.  the philosophres sworn were everichoon that they sholden discovere it unto noon  ne in no book it wryte in no manere; for unto crist it is so leef and dere that he wol nat that it discovered be but wher it lyketh to his deitee man for tenspyre and eek for to defende  whom that him lyketh; lo this is the ende. thanne conclude i thus; sith god of hevene ne wol nat that the philosophres nevene  how that a man shal come unto this stoon i rede as for the beste lete it goon.  for whoso maketh god his adversarie as for to werken any thing in contrarie of his wil certes never shal he thryve thogh that he multiplye terme of his lyve. and ther a poynt; for ended is my tale;  god sende every trewe man bote of his bale!amen.  here is ended the chanouns yemannes tale. here folweth the prologe of the maunciples tale. wite ye nat wher ther stant a litel toun which that ycleped is bobupanddoun under the blee in caunterbury weye? ther gan our hoste for to iape and pleye and seyde sirs what! dun is in the myre! is ther no man for preyere ne for hyre that wol awake our felawe heer bihinde? a theef mighte him ful lightly robbe and binde. see how he nappeth! see for cokkes bones as he wol falle from his hors at ones. is that a cook of londoun with meschaunce? do him come forth he knoweth his penaunce for he shal telle a tale by my fey! although it be nat worth a botel hey. awake thou cook quod he god yeve thee sorwe what eyleth thee to slepe by the morwe? hastow had fleen al night or artow dronke or hastow with som quene al night yswonke so that thou mayst nat holden up thyn heed? this cook that was ful pale and nothing reed  seyde to our host so god my soule blesse as ther is falle on me swich hevinesse noot i nat why that me were lever slepe than the beste galoun wyn in chepe. wel quod the maunciple if it may doon ese  to thee sir cook and to no wight displese which that heer rydeth in this companye and that our host wol of his curteisye i wol as now excuse thee of thy tale; for in good feith thy visage is ful pale  thyn yen daswen eek as that me thinketh and wel i woot thy breeth ful soure stinketh that sheweth wel thou art not wel disposed; of me certein thou shalt nat been yglosed. se how he ganeth lo this dronken wight  as though he wolde us swolwe anonright. hold cloos thy mouth man by thy fader kin! the devel of helle sette his foot therin! thy cursed breeth infecte wol us alle; fy stinking swyn fy! foule moot thee falle!  a! taketh heed sirs of this lusty man. now swete sir wol ye iusten atte fan? therto me thinketh ye been wel yshape! i trowe that ye dronken han wyn ape and that is whan men pleyen with a straw.  and with this speche the cook wex wrooth and wraw and on the maunciple he gan nodde faste for lakke of speche and doun the hors him caste wher as he lay til that men up him took; this was a fayr chivachee of a cook!  allas! he nadde holde him by his ladel! and er that he agayn were in his sadel ther was greet showving bothe to and fro to lifte him up and muchel care and wo so unweldy was this sory palled gost.  and to the maunciple thanne spak our host bycause drink hath dominacioun upon this man by my savacioun i trowe he lewedly wolde telle his tale. for were it wyn or old or moysty ale  that he hath dronke he speketh in his nose and fneseth faste and eek he hath the pose. he hath also to do more than ynough to kepe him and his capel out of slough; and if he falle from his capel eftsone  than shul we alle have ynough to done in lifting up his hevy dronken cors. telle on thy tale of him make i no fors. but yet maunciple in feith thou art to nyce thus openly repreve him of his vyce.  another day he wol peraventure reclayme thee and bringe thee to lure; i mene he speke wol of smale thinges as for to pinchen at thy rekeninges that wer not honeste if it cam to preef.  no quod the maunciple that were a greet mescheef! so mighte he lightly bringe me in the snare. yet hadde i lever payen for the mare which he rit on than he sholde with me stryve; i wol nat wratthe him also mote i thryve!  that that i spak i seyde it in my bourde; and wite ye what? i have heer in a gourde a draught of wyn ye of a rype grape and right anon ye shul seen a good iape. this cook shal drinke therof if i may;  up peyne of deeth he wol nat seye me nay! and certeinly to tellen as it was of this vessel the cook drank faste allas! what neded him? he drank ynough biforn. and whan he hadde pouped in this horn  to the maunciple he took the gourde agayn; and of that drinke the cook was wonder fayn and thanked him in swich wyse as he coude. than gan our host to laughen wonder loude and seyde i see wel it is necessarie  wher that we goon good drink we with us carie; for that wol turne rancour and disese tacord and love and many a wrong apese. o thou bachus yblessed be thy name that so canst turnen ernest into game!  worship and thank be to thy deitee! of that matere ye gete namore of me. tel on thy tale maunciple i thee preye. wel sir quod he now herkneth what i seye. thus endeth the prologe of the manciple. here biginneth the maunciples tale of the crowe. whan phebus dwelled here in this erthe adoun  as olde bokes maken mencioun he was the moste lusty bachiler in al this world and eek the beste archer; he slow phitoun the serpent as he lay slepinge agayn the sonne upon a day;  and many another noble worthy dede he with his bowe wroghte as men may rede. pleyen he coude on every minstralcye and singen that it was a melodye  to heren of his clere vois the soun.  certes the king of thebes amphioun that with his singing walled that citee coude never singen half so wel as he. therto he was the semelieste man that is or was sith that the world bigan.  what nedeth it his fetures to discryve? for in this world was noon so fair on lyve. he was therwith fulfild of gentillesse of honour and of parfit worthinesse.  this phebus that was flour of bachelrye  as wel in fredom as in chivalrye for his desport in signe eek of victorie of phitoun so as telleth us the storie was wont to beren in his hand a bowe. now had this phebus in his hous a crowe  which in a cage he fostred many a day and taughte it speken as men teche a iay. whyt was this crowe as is a snowwhyt swan and countrefete the speche of every man  he coude whan he sholde telle a tale.  therwith in al this world no nightingale ne coude by an hondred thousand deel singen so wonder merily and weel. now had this phebus in his hous a wyf which that he lovede more than his lyf  and night and day dide ever his diligence hir for to plese and doon hir reverence save only if the sothe that i shal sayn ialous he was and wolde have kept hir fayn;  for him were looth byiaped for to be.  and so is every wight in swich degree; but al in ydel for it availleth noght. a good wyf that is clene of werk and thoght sholde nat been kept in noon await certayn; and trewely the labour is in vayn  to kepe a shrewe for it wol nat be. this holde i for a verray nycetee to spille labour for to kepe wyves; thus writen olde clerkes in hir lyves.  but now to purpos as i first bigan:  this worthy phebus dooth all that he can to plesen hir weninge by swich plesaunce and for his manhede and his governaunce that no man sholde han put him from hir grace. but god it woot ther may no man embrace  as to destreyne a thing which that nature hath naturelly set in a creature. tak any brid and put it in a cage and do al thyn entente and thy corage  to fostre it tendrely with mete and drinke  of alle deyntees that thou canst bithinke and keep it also clenly as thou may; although his cage of gold be never so gay yet hath this brid by twenty thousand fold lever in a forest that is rude and cold  gon ete wormes and swich wrecchednesse. for ever this brid wol doon his bisinesse to escape out of his cage if he may; his libertee this brid desireth ay.  lat take a cat and fostre him wel with milk  and tendre flesh and make his couche of silk and lat him seen a mous go by the wal; anon he weyveth milk and flesh and al and every deyntee that is in that hous swich appetyt hath he to ete a mous.  lo here hath lust his dominacioun and appetyt flemeth discrecioun. a shewolf hath also a vileins kinde; the lewedeste wolf that she may finde  or leest of reputacion wol she take  in tyme whan hir lust to han a make. alle thise ensamples speke i by thise men that been untrewe and nothing by wommen. for men han ever a likerous appetyt on lower thing to parfourne hir delyt  than on hir wyves be they never so faire ne never so trewe ne so debonaire. flesh is so newefangel with meschaunce that we ne conne in nothing han plesaunce  that souneth into vertu any whyle.  this phebus which that thoghte upon no gyle deceyved was for al his iolitee; for under him another hadde she a man of litel reputacioun noght worth to phebus in comparisoun.  the more harm is; it happeth ofte so of which ther cometh muchel harm and wo. and so bifel whan phebus was absent his wyf anon hath for hir lemman sent  hir lemman? certes this is a knavish speche!  foryeveth it me and that i yow biseche. the wyse plato seith as ye may rede the word mot nede accorde with the dede. if men shal telle proprely a thing the word mot cosin be to the werking.  i am a boistous man right thus seye i ther nis no difference trewely bitwixe a wyf that is of heigh degree if of hir body dishonest she be  and a povre wenche other than this  if it so be they werke bothe amis but that the gentile in estaat above she shal be cleped his lady as in love; and for that other is a povre womman she shal be cleped his wenche or his lemman.  and god it wool myn owene dere brother men leyn that oon as lowe as lyth that other. right so bitwixe a titlelees tiraunt and an outlawe or a theef erraunt  the same i seye ther is no difference.  to alisaundre told was this sentence; that for the tyrant is of gretter might by force of meynee for to sleen dounright and brennen hous and hoom and make al plain lo! therfor is he cleped a capitain;  and for the outlawe hath but smal meynee and may nat doon so greet an harm as he ne bringe a contree to so greet mescheef men clepen him an outlawe or a theef.  but for i am a man noght textuel  i wol noght telle of textes never a del; i wol go to my tale as i bigan. whan phebus wyf had sent for hir lemman anon they wroghten al hir lust volage. the whyte crowe that heng ay in the cage  biheld hir werk and seyde never a word. and whan that hoom was come phebus the lord this crowe sang cokkow! cokkow! cokkow! what brid? quod phebus what song singestow?  ne were thow wont so merily to singe  that to myn herte it was a reioisinge to here thy vois? allas! what song is this? by god quod he i singe nat amis; phebus quod he for al thy worthinesse for al thy beautee and thy gentilesse  for al thy song and al thy minstralcye for al thy waiting blered is thyn ye with oon of litel reputacioun noght worth to thee as in comparisoun  the mountance of a gnat; so mote i thryve!  for on thy bed thy wyf i saugh him swyve. what wol ye more? the crowe anon him tolde by sadde tokenes and by wordes bolde how that his wyf had doon hir lecherye him to gret shame and to gret vileinye;  and tolde him ofte he saugh it with his yen. this phebus gan aweyward for to wryen him thoughte his sorweful herte brast atwo; his bowe he bente and sette therinne a flo  and in his ire his wyf thanne hath he slayn.  this is theffect ther is namore to sayn; for sorwe of which he brak his minstralcye bothe harpe and lute and giterne and sautrye; and eek he brak his arwes and his bowe. and after that thus spak he to the crowe:  traitour quod he with tonge of scorpioun thou hast me broght to my confusioun! allas! that i was wroght! why nere i deed? o dere wyf o gemme of lustiheed  that were to me so sad and eek so trewe  now lystow deed with face pale of hewe ful giltelees that dorste i swere ywis! o rakel hand to doon so foule amis! o trouble wit o ire recchelees that unavysed smytest giltelees!  o wantrust ful of fals suspecioun where was thy wit and thy discrecioun? o every man bewar of rakelnesse ne trowe nothing withouten strong witnesse;  smyt nat to sone er that ye witen why  and beeth avysed wel and sobrely er ye doon any execucioun upon your ire for suspecioun. allas! a thousand folk hath rakel ire fully fordoon and broght hem in the mire.  allas! for sorwe i wol myselven slee! and to the crowe o false theef! seyde he i wol thee quyte anon thy false tale! thou songe whylom lyk a nightingale;  now shaltow false theef thy song forgon  and eek thy whyte fetheres everichon ne never in al thy lyf ne shaltou speke. thus shal men on a traitour been awreke; thou and thyn ofspring ever shul be blake ne never swete noise shul ye make  but ever crye agayn tempest and rayn in tokeninge that thurgh thee my wyf is slayn. and to the crowe he stirte and that anon and pulled his whyte fetheres everichon  and made him blak and refte him al his song  and eek his speche and out at dore him slong unto the devel which i him bitake; and for this caas ben alle crowes blake. lordings by this ensample i yow preye beth war and taketh kepe what i seye:  ne telleth never no man in your lyf how that another man hath dight his wyf; he wol yow haten mortally certeyn. daun salomon as wyse clerkes seyn  techeth a man to kepe his tonge wel;  but as i seyde i am noght textuel. but nathelees thus taughte me my dame: my sone thenk on the crowe a goddes name; my sone keep wel thy tonge and keep thy freend. a wikked tonge is worse than a feend.  my sone from a feend men may hem blesse; my sone god of his endelees goodnesse walled a tonge with teeth and lippes eke for man sholde him avyse what he speke.  my sone ful ofte for to muche speche  hath many a man ben spilt as clerkes teche; but for a litel speche avysely is no men shent to speke generally. my sone thy tonge sholdestow restreyne at alle tyme but whan thou doost thy peyne  to speke of god in honour and preyere. the firste vertu sone if thou wolt lere is to restreyne and kepe wel thy tonge. thus lerne children whan that they ben yonge.  my sone of muchel speking yvelavysed  ther lasse speking hadde ynough suffysed comth muchel harm thus was me told and taught. in muchel speche sinne wanteth naught. wostow wherof a rakel tonge serveth? right as a swerd forcutteth and forkerveth  an arm atwo my dere sone right so a tonge cutteth frendship al atwo. a iangler is to god abhominable; reed salomon so wys and honurable;  reed david in his psalmes reed senekke.  my sone spek nat but with thyn heed thou bekke. dissimule as thou were deef if that thou here a iangler speke of perilous matere. the fleming seith and lerne it if thee leste that litel iangling causeth muchel reste.  my sone if thou no wikked word hast seyd thee thar nat drede for to be biwreyd; but he that hath misseyd i dar wel sayn he may by no wey clepe his word agayn.  thing that is seyd is seyd; and forth it gooth  though him repente or be him leef or looth. he is his thral to whom that he hath sayd a tale of which he is now yvel apayd. my sone be war and be non auctour newe of tydinges whether they ben false or trewe.  wherso thou come amonges hye or lowe kepe wel thy tonge and thenk upon the crowe. here is ended the maunciples tale of the crowe. here folweth the prologe of the persones tale. by that the maunciple hadde his tale al ended the sonne fro the south lyne was descended so lowe that he nas nat to my sighte degrees nyne and twenty as in highte. foure of the clokke it was tho as i gesse;  for eleven foot or litel more or lesse my shadwe was at thilke tyme as there of swich feet as my lengthe parted were in six feet equal of proporcioun. therwith the mones exaltacioun  i mene libra alwey gan ascende as we were entringe at a thropes ende; for which our host as he was wont to gye as in this caas our ioly companye seyde in this wyse lordings everichoon  now lakketh us no tales mo than oon. fulfild is my sentence and my decree; i trowe that we han herd of ech degree. almost fulfild is al myn ordinaunce; i prey to god so yeve him right good chaunce  that telleth this tale to us lustily. sir preest quod he artow a vicary? or art a person? sey sooth by thy fey! be what thou be ne breke thou nat our pley; for every man save thou hath told his tale  unbokel and shewe us what is in thy male; for trewely me thinketh by thy chere thou sholdest knitte up wel a greet matere. tel us a tale anon for cokkes bones! this persone him answerde al at ones  thou getest fable noon ytold for me; for paul that wryteth unto timothee repreveth hem that weyven soothfastnesse and tellen fables and swich wrecchednesse. why sholde i sowen draf out of my fest  whan i may sowen whete if that me lest? for which i seye if that yow list to here moralitee and vertuous matere and thanne that ye wol yeve me audience i wol ful fayn at cristes reverence  do yow plesaunce leefful as i can. but trusteth wel i am a southren man i can nat gesterum ram rufby lettre ne god wot rym holde i but litel bettre; and therfor if yow list i wol nat glose.  i wol yow telle a mery tale in prose to knitte up al this feeste and make an ende. and iesu for his grace wit me sende to shewe yow the wey in this viage of thilke parfit glorious pilgrimage  that highte ierusalem celestial. and if ye vouchesauf anon i shal biginne upon my tale for whiche i preye telle your avys i can no bettre seye. but nathelees this meditacioun  i putte it ay under correccioun of clerkes for i am nat textual; i take but the sentens trusteth wel. therfor i make protestacioun that i wol stonde to correccioun.  upon this word we han assented sone for as us semed it was for to done to enden in som vertuous sentence and for to yeve him space and audience; and bede our host he sholde to him seye  that alle we to telle his tale him preye. our host hadde the wordes for us alle: sir preest quod he now fayre yow bifalle! sey what yow list and we wol gladly here and with that word he seyde in this manere  telleth quod he your meditacioun. but hasteth yow the sonne wol adoun; beth fructuous and that in litel space and to do wel god sende yow his grace! explicit prohemium. state super vias et videte et interrogate de viis antiquis que sit via bona; et ambulate in ea et inuenietis refrigerium animabus vestris c. our swete lord god of hevene that no man wole perisse but wole that we comen alle to the knoweleche of him and to the blisful lyf that is perdurable  amonesteth us by the prophete ieremie that seith in this wyse:  stondeth upon the weyes and seeth and axeth of olde pathes that is to seyn of olde sentences which is the goode wey;  and walketh in that wey and ye shul finde refresshinge for your soules c.  manye been the weyes espirituels that leden folk to oure lord iesu crist and to the regne of glorie.  of whiche weyes ther is a ful noble wey and a ful covenable which may nat faile to man ne to womman that thurgh sinne hath misgoon fro the righte wey of ierusalem celestial;  and this wey is cleped penitence of which man sholde gladly herknen and enquere with al his herte;  to witen what is penitence and whennes it is cleped penitence and in how manye maneres been the accions or werkinges of penitence  and how manye spyces ther been of penitence and whiche thinges apertenen and bihoven to penitence and whiche thinges destourben penitence.  seint ambrose seith that penitence is the pleyninge of man for the gilt that he hath doon and namore to do any thing for which him oghte to pleyne.  and som doctour seith: penitence is the waymentinge of man that sorweth for his sinne and pyneth himself for he hath misdoon.  penitence with certeyne circumstances is verray repentance of a man that halt himself in sorwe and other peyne for hise giltes.  and for he shal be verray penitent he shal first biwailen the sinnes that he hath doon and stidefastly purposen in his herte to have shrift of mouthe and to doon satisfaccioun  and never to doon thing for which him oghte more to biwayle or to compleyne and to continue in goode werkes: or elles his repentance may nat availle.  for as seith seint isidre: he is a iaper and a gabber and no verray repentant that eftsoone dooth thing for which him oghte repente.  wepinge and nat for to stinte to doon sinne may nat avaylle.  but nathelees men shal hope that every tyme that man falleth be it never so ofte that he may arise thurgh penitence if he have grace: but certeinly it is greet doute.  for as seith seint gregorie: unnethe aryseth he out of sinne that is charged with the charge of yvel usage.  and therfore repentant folk that stinte for to sinne and forlete sinne er that sinne forlete hem holy chirche holdeth hem siker of hir savacioun.  and he that sinneth and verraily repenteth him in his laste ende holy chirche yet hopeth his savacioun by the grete mercy of oure lord iesu crist for his repentaunce; but tak the siker wey.  and now sith i have declared yow what thing is penitence now shul ye understonde that ther been three accions of penitence.  the firste accion of penitence is that a man be baptized after that he hath sinned.  seint augustin seith: but he be penitent for his olde sinful lyf he may nat biginne the newe clene lif.  for certes if he be baptized withouten penitence of his olde gilt he receiveth the mark of baptisme but nat the grace ne the remission of his sinnes til he have repentance verray.  another defaute is this that men doon deedly sinne after that they han received baptisme.  the thridde defaute is that men fallen in venial sinnes after hir baptisme fro day to day.  therof seith seint augustin that penitence of goode and humble folk is the penitence of every day.  the spyces of penitence been three. that oon of hem is solempne another is commune and the thridde is privee.  thilke penance that is solempne is in two maneres; as to be put out of holy chirche in lente for slaughtre of children and swich maner thing.  another is whan a man hath sinned openly of which sinne the fame is openly spoken in the contree; and thanne holy chirche by iugement destreineth him for to do open penaunce.  commune penaunce is that preestes enioinen men comunly in certeyn caas; as for to goon peraventure naked in pilgrimages or barefoot.  privee penaunce is thilke that men doon alday for privee sinnes of whiche we shryve us prively and receyve privee penaunce.  now shaltow understande what is bihovely and necessarie to verray parfit penitence. and this stant on three thinges;  contricioun of herte confessioun of mouth and satisfaccioun.  for which seith seint iohn crisostom: penitence destreyneth a man to accepte benignely every peyne that him is enioyned with contricion of herte and shrift of mouth with satisfaccion; and in werkinge of alle maner humilitee.  and this is fruitful penitence agayn three thinges in whiche we wratthe oure lord iesu crist:  this is to seyn by delyt in thinkinge by recchelesnesse in spekinge and by wikked sinful werkinge.  and agayns thise wikkede giltes is penitence that may be lykned unto a tree.  the rote of this tree is contricion that hydeth him in the herte of him that is verray repentant right as the rote of a tree hydeth him in the erthe.  of the rote of contricion springeth a stalke that bereth braunches and leves of confession and fruit of satisfaccion.  for which crist seith in his gospel: dooth digne fruit of penitence; for by this fruit may men knowe this tree and nat by the rote that is hid in the herte of man ne by the braunches ne by the leves of confession.  and therefore oure lord iesu crist seith thus: by the fruit of hem ye shul knowen hem.  of this rote eek springeth a seed of grace the which seed is moder of sikernesse and this seed is egre and hoot.  the grace of this seed springeth of god thurgh remembrance of the day of dome and on the peynes of helle.  of this matere seith salomon that in the drede of god man forleteth his sinne.  the hete of this seed is the love of god and the desiring of the ioye perdurable.  this hete draweth the herte of a man to god and dooth him haten his sinne.  for soothly ther is nothing that savoureth so wel to a child as the milk of his norice ne nothing is to him more abhominable than thilke milk whan it is medled with other mete.  right so the sinful man that loveth his sinne him semeth that it is to him most swete of anything;  but fro that tyme that he loveth sadly our lord iesu crist and desireth the lif perdurable ther nis to him nothing more abhominable.  for soothly the lawe of god is the love of god; for which david the prophete seith: i have loved thy lawe and hated wikkednesse and hate; he that loveth god kepeth his lawe and his word.  this tree saugh the prophete daniel in spirit upon the avision of the king nabugodonosor whan he conseiled him to do penitence.  penaunce is the tree of lyf to hem that it receiven and he that holdeth him in verray penitence is blessed; after the sentence of salomon.  in this penitence or contricion man shal understonde foure thinges that is to seyn what is contricion: and whiche been the causes that moeven a man to contricion: and how he sholde be contrit: and what contricion availleth to the soule.  thanne is it thus: that contricion is the verray sorwe that a man receiveth in his herte for his sinnes with sad purpos to shryve him and to do penaunce and nevermore to do sinne.  and this sorwe shal been in this manere as seith seint bernard: it shal been hevy and grevous and ful sharpe and poinant in herte.  first for man hath agilt his lord and his creatour; and more sharpe and poinant for he hath agilt his fader celestial;  and yet more sharpe and poinant for he hath wrathed and agilt him that boghte him; which with his precious blood hath delivered us fro the bondes of sinne and fro the crueltee of the devel and fro the peynes of helle.  the causes that oghte moeve a man to contricion been six. first a man shal remembre him of hise sinnes;  but loke he that thilke remembrance ne be to him no delyt by no wey but greet shame and sorwe for his gilt. for iob seith: sinful men doon werkes worthy of confession.  and therfore seith ezechie: i wol remembre me alle the yeres of my lyf in bitternesse of myn herte.  and god seith in the apocalips: remembreth yow fro whennes that ye been falle; for biforn that tyme that ye sinned ye were the children of god and limes of the regne of god;  but for your sinne ye been woxen thral and foul and membres of the feend hate of aungels sclaundre of holy chirche and fode of the false serpent; perpetuel matere of the fyr of helle.  and yet more foul and abhominable for ye trespassen so ofte tyme as doth the hound that retourneth to eten his spewing.  and yet be ye fouler for your longe continuing in sinne and your sinful usage for which ye be roten in your sinne as a beest in his dong.  swiche manere of thoghtes maken a man to have shame of his sinne and no delyt as god seith by the prophete ezechiel:  ye shal remembre yow of youre weyes and they shuln displese yow. sothly sinnes been the weyes that leden folk to helle.  the seconde cause that oghte make a man to have desdeyn of sinne is this: that as seith seint peter whoso that doth sinne is thral of sinne; and sinne put a man in greet thraldom.  and therfore seith the prophete ezechiel: i wente sorweful in desdayn of myself. and certes wel oghte a man have desdayn of sinne and withdrawe him from that thraldom and vileinye.  and lo what seith seneca in this matere. he seith thus: though i wiste that neither god ne man ne sholde nevere knowe it yet wolde i have desdayn for to do sinne.  and the same seneca also seith: i am born to gretter thinges than to be thral to my body or than for to maken of my body a thral.  ne a fouler thral may no man ne womman maken of his body than for to yeven his body to sinne.  al were it the fouleste cherl or the fouleste womman that liveth and leest of value yet is he thanne more foule and more in servitute.  evere fro the hyer degree that man falleth the more is he thral and more to god and to the world vile and abhominable.  o gode god wel oghte man have desdayn of sinne; sith that thurgh sinne ther he was free now is he maked bonde.  and therfore seyth seint augustin: if thou hast desdayn of thy servant if he agilte or sinne have thou thanne desdayn that thou thyself sholdest do sinne.  take reward of thy value that thou ne be to foul to thyself.  allas! wel oghten they thanne have desdayn to been servauntz and thralles to sinne and sore been ashamed of hemself  that god of his endelees goodnesse hath set hem in heigh estaat or yeven hem wit strengthe of body hele beautee prosperitee  and boghte hem fro the deeth with his herte blood that they so unkindely agayns his gentilesse quyten him so vileinsly to slaughtre of hir owene soules.  o gode god ye wommen that been of so greet beautee remembreth yow of the proverbe of salomon that seith:  he lykneth a fair womman that is a fool of hir body lyk to a ring of gold that were in the groyn of a sowe.  for right as a sowe wroteth in everich ordure so wroteth she hir beautee in the stinkinge ordure of sinne.  the thridde cause that oghte moeve a man to contricion is drede of the day of dome and of the horrible peynes of helle.  for as seint ierome seith: at every tyme that me remembreth of the day of dome i quake;  for whan i ete or drinke or whatso that i do evere semeth me that the trompe sowneth in myn ere:  riseth up ye that been dede and cometh to the iugement.  o gode god muchel oghte a man to drede swich a iugement theras we shullen been alle as seint poul seith biforn the sete of oure lord iesu crist;  wheras he shal make a general congregacion wheras no man may been absent.  for certes there availleth noon essoyne ne excusacion.  and nat only that oure defautes shullen be iuged but eek that alle oure werkes shullen openly be knowe.  and as seith seint bernard: ther ne shal no pledinge availle ne no sleighte; we shullen yeven rekeninge of everich ydel word.  ther shul we han a iuge that may nat been deceived ne corrupt. and why? for certes alle our thoghtes been discovered as to him; ne for preyere ne for mede he shal nat been corrupt.  and therfore seith salomon: the wratthe of god ne wol nat spare no wight for preyere ne for yifte; and therfore at the day of doom ther nis noon hope to escape.  wherfore as seith seint anselm: ful greet angwissh shul the sinful folk have at that tyme;  ther shal the sterne and wrothe iuge sitte above and under him the horrible put of helle open to destroyen him that moot biknowen hise sinnes whiche sinnes openly been shewed biforn god and biforn every creature.  and on the left syde mo develes than herte may bithinke for to harie and drawe the sinful soules to the pyne of helle.  and withinne the hertes of folk shal be the bytinge conscience and withouteforth shal be the world al brenninge.  whider shal thanne the wrecched sinful man flee to hyden him? certes he may nat hyden him; he moste come forth and shewen him.  for certes as seith seint ierome: the erthe shal casten him out of him and the see also; and the eyr also that shal be ful of thonderclappes and lightninges.  now sothly whoso wel remembreth him of thise thinges i gesse that his sinne shal nat turne him into delyt but to greet sorwe for drede of the peyne of helle.  and therfore seith iob to god: suffre lord that i may a whyle biwaille and wepe er i go withoute returning to the derke lond covered with the derknesse of deeth;  to the lond of misese and of derknesse whereas is the shadwe of deeth; whereas ther is noon ordre or ordinance but grisly drede that evere shal laste.  lo here may ye seen that iob preyde respyt a whyle to biwepe and waille his trespas; for soothly oon day of respyt is bettre than al the tresor of the world.  and forasmuche as a man may acquiten himself biforn god by penitence in this world and nat by tresor therfore sholde he preye to god to yeve him respyt a whyle to biwepe and biwaillen his trespas.  for certes al the sorwe that a man mighte make fro the beginning of the world nis but a litel thing at regard of the sorwe of helle.  the cause why that iob clepeth helle the lond of derknesse;  understondeth that he clepeth it londe or erthe for it is stable and nevere shal faille; derk for he that is in helle hath defaute of light material.  for certes the derke light that shal come out of the fyr that evere shal brenne shal turne him al to peyne that is in helle; for it sheweth him to the horrible develes that him tormenten.  covered with the derknesse of deeth: that is to seyn that he that is in helle shal have defaute of the sighte of god; for certes the sighte of god is the lyf perdurable.  the derknesse of deeth been the sinnes that the wrecched man hath doon whiche that destourben him to see the face of god; right as doth a derk cloude bitwixe us and the sonne.  lond of misese: bycause that ther been three maneres of defautes agayn three thinges that folk of this world han in this present lyf that is to seyn honours delyces and richesses.  agayns honour have they in helle shame and confusion.  for wel ye woot that men clepen honour the reverence that man doth to man; but in helle is noon honour ne reverence. for certes namore reverence shal be doon there to a king than to a knave.  for which god seith by the prophete ieremye: thilke folk that me despysen shul been in despyt.  honour is eek cleped greet lordshipe; ther shal no man serven other but of harm and torment. honour is eek cleped greet dignitee and heighnesse; but in helle shul they been al fortroden of develes.  and god seith: the horrible develes shulle goon and comen upon the hevedes of the dampned folk. and this is forasmuche as the hyer that they were in this present lyf the more shulle they been abated and defouled in helle.  agayns the richesses of this world shul they han misese of poverte; and this poverte shal been in foure thinges:  in defaute of tresor of which that david seith; the riche folk that embraceden and oneden al hir herte to tresor of this world shul slepe in the slepinge of deeth; and nothing ne shul they finden in hir handes of al hir tresor.  and moreover the miseise of helle shal been in defaute of mete and drinke.  for god seith thus by moyses; they shul been wasted with hunger and the briddes of helle shul devouren hem with bitter deeth and the galle of the dragon shal been hir drinke and the venim of the dragon hir morsels.  and fortherover hir miseise shal been in defaute of clothing: for they shulle be naked in body as of clothing save the fyr in which they brenne and othere filthes;  and naked shul they been of soule of alle manere vertues which that is the clothing of the soule. where been thanne the gaye robes and the softe shetes and the smale shertes?  lo what seith god of hem by the prophete isaye: that under hem shul been strawed motthes and hir covertures shulle been of wormes of helle.  and fortherover hir miseise shal been in defaute of freendes; for he nis nat povre that hath goode freendes but there is no freend;  for neither god ne no creature shal been freend to hem and everich of hem shal haten other with deedly hate.  the sones and the doghtren shullen rebellen agayns fader and mooder and kinrede agayns kinrede and chyden and despysen everich of hem other bothe day and night as god seith by the prophete michias.  and the lovinge children that whylom loveden so fleshly everich other wolden everich of hem eten other if they mighte.  for how sholden they love hem togidre in the peyne of helle whan they hated ech of hem other in the prosperitee of this lyf?  for truste wel hir fleshly love was deedly hate; as seith the prophete david: whoso that loveth wikkednesse he hateth his soule.  and whoso hateth his owene soule certes he may love noon other wight in no manere.  and therefore in helle is no solas ne no frendshipe but evere the more fleshly kinredes that been in helle the more cursinges the more chydinges and the more deedly hate ther is among hem.  and fortherover they shul have defaute of alle manere delyces; for certes delyces been after the appetytes of the fyve wittes as sighte heringe smellinge savoringe and touchinge.  but in helle hir sighte shal be ful of derknesse and of smoke and therfore ful of teres; and hir heringe ful of waymentinge and of grintinge of teeth as seith iesu crist;  hir nosethirles shullen be ful of stinkinge stink. and as seith isaye the prophete: hir savoring shal be ful of bitter galle.  and touchinge of al hir body ycovered with fyr that nevere shal quenche and with wormes that nevere shul dyen as god seith by the mouth of isaye.  and forasmuche as they shul nat wene that they may dyen for peyne and by hir deeth flee fro peyne that may they understonden by the word of iob that seith: theras is the shadwe of deeth.  certes a shadwe hath the lyknesse of the thing of which it is shadwe but shadwe is nat the same thing of which it is shadwe.  right so fareth the peyne of helle; it is lyk deeth for the horrible anguissh and why? for it peyneth hem evere as though they sholde dye anon; but certes they shal nat dye.  for as seith seint gregorie: to wrecche caytives shal be deeth withoute deeth and ende withouten ende and defaute withoute failinge.  for hir deeth shal alwey liven and hir ende shal everemo biginne and hir defaute shal nat faille.  and therfore seith seint iohn the evangelist: they shullen folwe deeth and they shul nat finde him; and they shul desyren to dye and deeth shal flee fro hem.  and eek iob seith: that in helle is noon ordre of rule.  and albeit so that god hath creat alle thinges in right ordre and nothing withouten ordre but alle thinges been ordeyned and nombred; yet nathelees they that been dampned been nothing in ordre ne holden noon ordre.  for the erthe ne shal bere hem no fruit.  for as the prophete david seith: god shal destroie the fruit of the erthe as fro hem; ne water ne shal yeve hem no moisture; ne the eyr no refresshing ne fyr no light.  for as seith seint basilie: the brenninge of the fyr of this world shal god yeven in helle to hem that been dampned;  but the light and the cleernesse shal be yeven in hevene to hise children; right as the gode man yeveth flesh to hise children and bones to his houndes.  and for they shullen have noon hope to escape seith seint iob atte laste: that ther shal horrour and grisly drede dwellen withouten ende.  horrour is alwey drede of harm that is to come and this drede shal evere dwelle in the hertes of hem that been dampned. and therefore han they lorn al hir hope for sevene causes.  first for god that is hir iuge shal be withouten mercy to hem; ne they may nat plese him ne noon of hise halwes; ne they ne may yeve nothing for hir raunson;  ne they have no vois to speke to him; ne they may nat flee fro peyne; ne they have no goodnesse in hem that they mowe shewe to delivere hem fro peyne.  and therfore seith salomon: the wikked man dyeth; and whan he is deed he shal have noon hope to escape fro peyne.  whoso thanne wolde wel understande these peynes and bithinke him weel that he hath deserved thilke peynes for his sinnes certes he sholde have more talent to syken and to wepe than for to singen and to pleye.  for as that seith salomon: whoso that hadde the science to knowe the peynes that been establissed and ordeyned for sinne he wolde make sorwe.  thilke science as seith seint augustin maketh a man to waymenten in his herte.  the fourthe point that oghte maken a man to have contricion is the sorweful remembrance of the good that he hath left to doon here in erthe; and eek the good that he hath lorn.  soothly the gode werkes that he hath left outher they been the gode werkes that he wroghte er he fel into deedly sinne or elles the gode werkes that he wroghte while he lay in sinne.  soothly the gode werkes that he dide biforn that he fil in sinne been al mortified and astoned and dulled by the ofte sinning.  the othere gode werkes that he wroghte whyl he lay in deedly sinne they been outrely dede as to the lyf perdurable in hevene.  thanne thilke gode werkes that been mortified by ofte sinning whiche gode werkes he dide whyl he was in charitee ne mowe nevere quiken agayn withouten verray penitence.  and therof seith god by the mouth of ezechiel: that if the rightful man returne agayn from his rightwisnesse and werke wikkednesse shal he live?  nay; for alle the gode werkes that he hath wroght ne shul nevere been in remembrance; for he shal dyen in his sinne.  and upon thilke chapitre seith seint gregorie thus: that we shulle understonde this principally;  that whan we doon deedly sinne it is for noght thanne to rehercen or drawen into memorie the gode werkes that we han wroght biforn.  for certes in the werkinge of the deedly sinne ther is no trust to no good werk that we han doon biforn; that is to seyn as for to have therby the lyf perdurable in hevene.  but nathelees the gode werkes quiken agayn and comen agayn and helpen and availlen to have the lyf perdurable in hevene whan we han contricion.  but soothly the gode werkes that men doon whyl they been in deedly sinne forasmuche as they were doon in deedly sinne they may nevere quiken agayn.  for certes thing that nevere hadde lyf may nevere quikene; and nathelees albeit that they ne availle noght to han the lyf perdurable yet availlen they to abregge of the peyne of helle or elles to geten temporal richesse  or elles that god wole the rather enlumine and lightne the herte of the sinful man to have repentance;  and eek they availlen for to usen a man to doon gode werkes that the feend have the lasse power of his soule.  and thus the curteis lord iesu crist wole that no good werk be lost; for in somwhat it shal availle.  but forasmuche as the gode werkes that men doon whyl they been in good lyf been al mortified by sinne folwinge; and eek sith that alle the gode werkes that men doon whyl they been in deedly synne been outrely dede as for to have the lyf perdurable;  wel may that man that no good werke ne dooth singe thilke newe frenshe song: iay tout perdu mon temps et mon labour.  for certes sinne bireveth a man bothe goodnesse of nature and eek the goodnesse of grace.  for soothly the grace of the holy goost fareth lyk fyr that may nat been ydel; for fyr faileth anoon as it forleteth his wirkinge and right so grace fayleth anoon as it forleteth his werkinge.  than leseth the sinful man the goodnesse of glorie that only is bihight to gode men that labouren and werken.  wel may he be sory thanne that oweth al his lif to god as longe as he hath lived and eek as longe as he shal live that no goodnesse ne hath to paye with his dette to god to whom he oweth al his lyf.  for trust wel he shal yeven acountes as seith seint bernard of alle the godes that han be yeven him in this present lyf and how he hath hem despended;  in so muche that ther shal nat perisse an heer of his heed ne a moment of an houre ne shal nat perisse of his tyme that he ne shal yeve of it a rekening.  the fifthe thing that oghte moeve a man to contricion is remembrance of the passion that oure lord iesu crist suffred for our sinnes.  for as seith seint bernard: whyl that i live i shal have remembrance of the travailles that oure lord crist suffred in preching;  his werinesse in travailling hise temptacions whan he fasted hise longe wakinges whan he preyde hise teres whan that he weep for pitee of good peple;  the wo and the shame and the filthe that men seyden to him; of the foule spitting that men spitte in his face of the buffettes that men yaven him of the foule mowes and of the repreves that men to him seyden;  of the nayles with whiche he was nailed to the croys and of al the remenant of his passion that he suffred for my sinnes and nothing for his gilt.  and ye shul understonde that in mannes sinne is every manere of ordre or ordinance turned upsodoun.  for it is sooth that god and reson and sensualitee and the body of man been so ordeyned that everich of thise foure thinges sholde have lordshipe over that other;  as thus: god sholde have lordshipe over reson and reson over sensualitee and sensualitee over the body of man.  but sothly whan man sinneth al this ordre or ordinance is turned upsodoun.  and therfore thanne forasmuche as the reson of man ne wol nat be subget ne obeisant to god that is his lord by right therfore leseth it the lordshipe that it sholde have over sensualitee and eek over the body of man.  and why? for sensualitee rebelleth thanne agayns reson; and by that wey leseth reson the lordshipe over sensualitee and over the body.  for right as reson is rebel to god right so is bothe sensualitee rebel to reson and the body also.  and certes this disordinance and this rebellion oure lord iesu crist aboghte upon his precious body ful dere and herkneth in which wyse.  forasmuche thanne as reson is rebel to god therfore is man worthy to have sorwe and to be deed.  this suffred oure lord iesu crist for man after that he hadde be bitraysed of his disciple and distreyned and bounde so that his blood brast out at every nail of hise handes as seith seint augustin.  and fortherover forasmuchel as reson of man ne wol nat daunte sensualitee whan it may therfore is man worthy to have shame; and this suffred oure lord iesu crist for man whan they spetten in his visage.  and fortherover forasmuchel thanne as the caitif body of man is rebel bothe to reson and to sensualitee therfore is it worthy the deeth.  and this suffred oure lord iesu crist for man upon the croys whereas ther was no part of his body free withouten greet peyne and bitter passion.  and al this suffred iesu crist that nevere forfeted. and therfore resonably may be seyd of iesu in this manere: to muchel am i peyned for the thinges that i nevere deserved and to muche defouled for shendshipe that man is worthy to have.  and therfore may the sinful man wel seye as seith seint bernard: acursed be the bitternesse of my sinne for which ther moste be suffred so muchel bitternesse.  for certes after the diverse discordances of oure wikkednesses was the passion of iesu crist ordeyned in diverse thinges  as thus. certes sinful mannes soule is bitraysed of the devel by coveitise of temporel prosperitee and scorned by deceite whan he cheseth fleshly delyces; and yet is it tormented by inpacience of adversitee and bispet by servage and subieccion of sinne; and atte laste it is slayn fynally.  for this disordinaunce of sinful man was iesu crist first bitraysed and after that was he bounde that cam for to unbynden us of sinne and peyne.  thanne was he biscorned that only sholde han been honoured in alle thinges and of alle thinges.  thanne was his visage that oghte be desired to be seyn of al mankinde in which visage aungels desyren to looke vileynsly bispet.  thanne was he scourged that nothing hadde agilt; and fynally thanne was he crucified and slayn.  thanne was acompliced the word of isaye: he was wounded for oure misdedes and defouled for oure felonies.  now sith that iesu crist took upon himself the peyne of alle oure wikkednesses muchel oghte sinful man wepen and biwayle that for hise sinnes goddes sone of hevene sholde al this peyne endure.  the sixte thing that oghte moeve a man to contricion is the hope of three thynges; that is to seyn foryifnesse of sinne and the yifte of grace wel for to do and the glorie of hevene with which god shal guerdone a man for hise gode dedes.  and forasmuche as iesu crist yeveth us thise yiftes of his largesse and of his sovereyn bountee therfore is he cleped iesus nazarenus rex iudeorum.  iesus is to seyn saveour or salvacion on whom men shul hope to have foryifnesse of sinnes which that is proprely salvacion of sinnes.  and therfore seyde the aungel to ioseph: thou shall clepen his name iesus that shal saven his peple of hir sinnes.  and heerof seith seint peter: ther is noon other name under hevene that is yeve to any man by which a man may be saved but only iesus.  nazarenus is as muche for to seye as florisshinge in which a man shal hope that he that yeveth him remission of sinnes shal yeve him eek grace wel for to do. for in the flour is hope of fruit in tyme cominge; and in foryifnesse of sinnes hope of grace wel for to do.  i was atte dore of thyn herte seith iesus and cleped for to entre; he that openeth to me shal have foryifnesse of sinne.  i wol entre into him by my grace and soupe with him by the goode werkes that he shal doon; whiche werkes been the foode of god; and he shal soupe with me by the grete ioye that i shal yeven him.  thus shal man hope for hise werkes of penaunce that god shall yeven him his regne; as he bihoteth him in the gospel.  now shal a man understonde in which manere shal been his contricion. i seye that it shal been universal and total; this is to seyn a man shal be verray repentant for alle hise sinnes that he hath doon in delyt of his thoght; for delyt is ful perilous.  for ther been two manere of consentinges; that oon of hem is cleped consentinge of affeccion when a man is moeved to do sinne and delyteth him longe for to thinke on that sinne;  and his reson aperceyveth it wel that it is sinne agayns the lawe of god and yet his reson refreyneth nat his foul delyt or talent though he se wel apertly that it is agayns the reverence of god; although his reson ne consente noght to doon that sinne in dede  yet seyn somme doctours that swich delyt that dwelleth longe it is ful perilous al be it nevere so lite.  and also a man sholde sorwe namely for al that evere he hath desired agayn the lawe of god with perfit consentinge of his reson; for therof is no doute that it is deedly sinne in consentinge.  for certes ther is no deedly sinne that it nas first in mannes thought and after that in his delyt; and so forth into consentinge and into dede.  wherfore i seye that many men ne repenten hem nevere of swiche thoghtes and delytes ne nevere shryven hem of it but only of the dede of grete sinnes outward.  wherfore i seye that swiche wikked delytes and wikked thoghtes been subtile bigyleres of hem that shullen be dampned.  moreover man oghte to sorwe for hise wikkede wordes as wel as for hise wikkede dedes; for certes the repentance of a singuler sinne and nat repente of alle hise othere sinnes or elles repenten him of alle hise othere sinnes and nat of a singuler sinne may nat availle.  for certes god almighty is al good; and therfore he foryeveth al or elles right noght.  and heerof seith seint augustin: i woot certainly  that god is enemy to everich sinnere; and how thanne? he that observeth o sinne shal he have foryifnesse of the remenaunt of hise othere sinnes? nay.  and fortherover contricion sholde be wonder sorweful and anguissous and therfore yeveth him god pleynly his mercy; and therfore whan my soule was anguissous withinne me i hadde remembrance of god that my preyere mighte come to him.  fortherover contricion moste be continuel and that man have stedefast purpos to shryven him and for to amenden him of his lyf.  for soothly whyl contricion lasteth man may evere have hope of foryifnesse; and of this comth hate of sinne that destroyeth sinne bothe in himself and eek in other folk at his power.  for which seith david: ye that loven god hateth wikkednesse. for trusteth wel to love god is for to love that he loveth and hate that he hateth.  the laste thing that man shal understonde in contricion is this; wherof avayleth contricion. i seye that som tyme contricion delivereth a man fro sinne;  of which that david seith: i seye quod david that is to seyn i purposed fermely to shryve me; and thow lord relesedest my sinne.  and right so as contricion availleth noght withouten sad purpos of shrifte if man have oportunitee right so litel worth is shrifte or satisfaccion withouten contricion.  and moreover contricion destroyeth the prison of helle and maketh wayk and feble alle the strengthes of the develes and restoreth the yiftes of the holy goost and of alle gode vertues;  and it clenseth the soule of sinne and delivereth the soule fro the peyne of helle and fro the companye of the devel and fro the servage of sinne and restoreth it to alle godes espirituels and to the companye and communion of holy chirche.  and fortherover it maketh him that whylom was sone of ire to be sone of grace; and alle thise thinges been preved by holy writ.  and therfore he that wolde sette his entente to thise thinges he were ful wys; for soothly he ne sholde nat thanne in al his lyf have corage to sinne but yeven his body and al his herte to the service of iesu crist and therof doon him hommage.  for soothly oure swete lord iesu crist hath spared us so debonairly in our folies that if he ne hadde pitee of mannes soule a sory song we mighten alle singe.  explicit prima pars penitentie; et sequitur secunda pars eiusdem. the seconde partie of penitence is confession that is signe of contricion.  now shul ye understonde what is confession and whether it oghte nedes be doon or noon and whiche thinges been covenable to verray confession.  first shaltow understonde that confession is verray shewinge of sinnes to the preest;  this is to seyn verray for he moste confessen him of alle the condiciouns that bilongen to his sinne as ferforth as he can.  al moot be seyd and no thing excused ne hid ne forwrapped and noght avaunte him of his gode werkes.  and forther over it is necessarie to understonde whennes that sinnes springen and how they encresen and whiche they been.  of the springinge of sinnes seith seint paul in this wise: that right as by a man sinne entred first into this world and thurgh that sinne deeth right so thilke deeth entred into alle men that sinneden.  and this man was adam by whom sinne entred into this world whan he brak the comaundement of god.  and therfore he that first was so mighty that he sholde not have dyed bicam swich oon that he moste nedes dye whether he wolde or noon; and all his progenie in this world that in thilke man sinneden.  loke that in thestaat of innocence when adam and eve naked weren in paradys and nothing ne hadden shame of hir nakednesse  how that the serpent that was most wyly of alle othere bestes that god hadde maked seyde to the womman: why comaunded god to yow ye sholde nat eten of every tree in paradys?  the womman answerde: of the fruit quod she of the trees in paradys we feden us; but soothly of the fruit of the tree that is in the middel of paradys god forbad us for to ete ne nat touchen it lest peraventure we should dyen.  the serpent seyde to the womman: nay nay ye shul nat dyen of deeth; for sothe god woot that what day that ye eten therof youre eyen shul opene and ye shul been as goddes knowinge good and harm.  the womman thanne saugh that the tree was good to feding and fair to the eyen and delytable to the sighte; she tok of the fruit of the tree and eet it and yaf to hir housbonde and he eet; and anoon the eyen of hem bothe openeden.  and whan that they knewe that they were naked they sowed of figeleves a manere of breches to hiden hir membres.  there may ye seen that deedly sinne hath first suggestion of the feend as sheweth here by the naddre; and afterward the delyt of the flesh as sheweth here by eve; and after that the consentinge of resoun as sheweth here by adam.  for trust wel thogh so were that the feend tempted eve that is to seyn the flesh and the flesh hadde delyt in the beautee of the fruit defended yet certes til that resoun that is to seyn adam consented to the etinge of the fruit yet stood he in thestaat of innocence.  of thilke adam toke we thilke sinne original; for of him fleshly descended be we alle and engendred of vile and corrupt matere.  and whan the soule is put in our body right anon is contract original sinne; and that that was erst but only peyne of concupiscence is afterward bothe peyne and sinne.  and therfore be we alle born sones of wratthe and of dampnacion perdurable if it nere baptesme that we receyven which binimeth us the culpe; but for sothe the peyne dwelleth with us as to temptacion which peyne highte concupiscence.  whan it is wrongfully disposed or ordeyned in man it maketh him coveite by coveitise of flesh fleshly sinne by sighte of hise eyen as to erthely thinges. and coveitise of hynesse by pryde of herte.  now as for to speken of the firste coveitise that is concupiscence after the lawe of oure membres that weren lawefulliche ymaked and by rightful iugement of god;  i seye forasmuche as man is nat obeisaunt to god that is his lord therfore is the flesh to him disobeisaunt thurgh concupiscence which yet is cleped norissinge of sinne and occasion of sinne.  therfore al the whyle that a man hath in him the peyne of concupiscence it is impossible but he be tempted somtyme and moeved in his flesh to sinne. and this thing may nat faille as longe as he liveth; it may wel wexe feble and faille by vertu of baptesme and by the grace of god thurgh penitence;  but fully ne shal it nevere quenche that he ne shal som tyme be moeved in himself butif he were al refreyded by siknesse or by malefice of sorcerie or colde drinkes.  for lo what seith seint paul: the flesh coveiteth agayn the spirit and the spirit agayn the flesh; they been so contrarie and so stryven that a man may nat alwey doon as he wolde.  the same seint paul after his grete penaunce in water and in lond in water by night and by day in greet peril and in greet peyne in lond in famine in thurst in cold and clothlees and ones stoned almost to the deeth  yet seyde he: allas! i caytif man who shal delivere me fro the prisoun of my caytif body?  and seint ierome whan he longe tyme hadde woned in desert whereas he hadde no companye but of wilde bestes whereas he ne hadde no mete but herbes and water to his drinke ne no bed but the naked erthe for which his flesh was blak as an ethiopen for hete and ny destroyed for cold  yet seyde he: that the brenninge of lecherie boiled in al his body.  wherfore i woot wel sikerly that they been deceyved that seyn that they ne be nat tempted in hir body.  witnesse on seint iame the apostel that seith: that every wight is tempted in his owen concupiscence: that is to seyn that everich of us hath matere and occasion to be tempted of the norissinge of sinne that is in his body.  and therfore seith seint iohn the evaungelist: if that we seyn that we beth withoute sinne we deceyve usselve and trouthe is nat in us.  now shal ye understonde in what manere that sinne wexeth or encreseth in man. the firste thing is thilke norissinge of sinne of which i spak biforn thilke fleshly concupiscence.  and after that comth the subieccion of the devel this is to seyn the develes bely with which he bloweth in man the fyr of fleshly concupiscence.  and after that a man bithinketh him whether he wol doon or no thilke thing to which he is tempted.  and thanne if that a man withstonde and weyve the firste entysinge of his flesh and of the feend thanne is it no sinne; and if it so be that he do nat so thanne feleth he anon a flambe of delyt.  and thanne is it good to be war and kepen him wel or elles he wol falle anon into consentinge of sinne; and thanne wol he do it if he may have tyme and place.  and of this matere seith moyses by the devel in this manere: the feend seith i wole chace and pursue the man by wikked suggestion and i wole hente him by moevynge or stiringe of sinne. i wol departe my pryse or my praye by deliberacion and my lust shal been accompliced in delyt; i wol drawe my swerd in consentinge:  for certes right as a swerd departeth a thing in two peces right so consentinge departeth god fro man: and thanne wol i sleen him with myn hand in dede of sinne; thus seith the feend.  for certes thanne is a man al deed in soule. and thus is sinne accompliced by temptacion by delyt and by consentinge; and thanne is the sin cleped actuel.  for sothe sinne is in two maneres; outher it is venial or deedly sinne. soothly whan man loveth any creature more than iesu crist oure creatour thanne is it deedly sinne. and venial synne is it if man love iesu crist lasse than him oghte.  for sothe the dede of this venial sinne is ful perilous; for it amenuseth the love that men sholde han to god more and more.  and therfore if a man charge himself with manye swiche venial sinnes certes butif so be that he som tyme descharge him of hem by shrifte they mowe ful lightly amenuse in him al the love that he hath to iesu crist;  and in this wise skippeth venial into deedly sinne. for certes the more that a man chargeth his soule with venial sinnes the more is he enclyned to fallen into deedly sinne.  and therfore lat us nat be necligent to deschargen us of venial sinnes. for the proverbe seith: that manye smale maken a greet.  and herkne this ensample. a greet wawe of the see comth somtyme with so greet a violence that it drencheth the ship. and the same harm doth somtyme the smale dropes of water that entren thurgh a litel crevace into the thurrok and into the botme of the ship if men be so necligent that they ne descharge hem nat by tyme.  and therfore althogh ther be a difference bitwixe thise two causes of drenchinge algates the ship is dreynt.  right so fareth it somtyme of deedly sinne and of anoyouse veniale sinnes whan they multiplye in a man so greetly that thilke worldly thinges that he loveth thurgh whiche he sinneth venially is as greet in his herte as the love of god or more.  and therfore the love of every thing that is nat biset in god ne doon principally for goddes sake although that a man love it lasse than god yet is it venial sinne;  and deedly sinne whan the love of any thing weyeth in the herte of man as muchel as the love of god or more.  deedly sinne as seith seint augustin is whan a man turneth his herte fro god which that is verray sovereyn bountee that may nat chaunge and yeveth his herte to thing that may chaunge and flitte;  and certes that is every thing save god of hevene. for sooth is that if a man yeve his love the which that he oweth al to god with al his herte unto a creature certes as muche of his love as he yeveth to thilke creature so muche he bireveth fro god;  and therfore doth he sinne. for he that is dettour to god ne yeldeth nat to god al his dette that is to seyn al the love of his herte.  now sith man understondeth generally which is venial sinne thanne is it covenable to tellen specially of sinnes whiche that many a man peraventure ne demeth hem nat sinnes and ne shryveth him nat of the same thinges; and yet nathelees they been sinnes.  soothly as thise clerkes wryten this is to seyn that at every tyme that a man eteth or drinketh more than suffyseth to the sustenaunce of his body in certein he dooth sinne.  and eek whan he speketh more than nedeth it is sinne. eke whan he herkneth nat benignely the compleint of the povre.  eke whan he is in hele of body and wol nat faste whan othere folk faste withouten cause resonable. eke whan he slepeth more than nedeth or whan he comth by thilke enchesoun to late to chirche or to othere werkes of charite.  eke whan he useth his wyf withouten sovereyn desyr of engendrure to the honour of god or for the entente to yelde to his wyf the dette of his body.  eke whan he wol nat visite the sike and the prisoner if he may. eke if he love wyf or child or other worldly thing more than resoun requyreth. eke if he flatere or blandishe more than him oghte for any necessitee.  eke if he amenuse or withdrawe the almesse of the povre. eke if he apparailleth his mete more deliciously than nede is or ete it to hastily by likerousnesse.  eke if he tale vanitees at chirche or at goddes service or that he be a talker ot ydel wordes of folye or of vileinye; for he shal yelden acountes of it at the day of dome.  eke whan he biheteth or assureth to do thinges that he may nat perfourne. eke whan that he by lightnesse or folie misseyeth or scorneth his neighebore.  eke whan he hath any wikked suspecion of thing ther he ne woot of it no soothfastnesse.  thise thinges and mo withoute nombre been sinnes as seith seint augustin.  now shal men understonde that albeit so that noon erthely man may eschue alle venial sinnes yet may he refreyne him by the brenninge love that he hath to oure lord iesu crist and by preyeres and confession and othere gode werkes so that it shal but litel greve.  for as seith seint augustin: if a man love god in swiche manere that al that evere he doth is in the love of god and for the love of god verraily for he brenneth in the love of god:  loke how muche that a drope of water that falleth in a fourneys ful of fyr anoyeth or greveth so muche anoyeth a venial sinne unto a man that is parfit in the love of iesu crist.  men may also refreyne venial sinne by receyvinge worthily of the precious body of iesu crist;  by receyving eek of holy water; by almesdede; by general confession of confiteor at masse and at complin; and by blessinge of bisshopes and of preestes and by othere gode werkes.  explicit secunda pars penitentie. sequitur de septem peccatis mortalibus et eorum dependenciis circumstanciis et speciebus. now is it bihovely thing to telle whiche been the deedly sinnes this is to seyn chieftaines of sinnes; alle they renne in o lees but in diverse maneres. now been they cleped chieftaines forasmuche as they been chief and springers of alle othere sinnes.  of the roote of thise sevene sinnes thanne is pryde the general rote of alle harmes; for of this rote springen certein braunches as ire envye accidie or slewthe avarice or coveitise to commune understondinge glotonye and lecherye.  and everich of thise chief sinnes hath hise braunches and hise twigges as shal be declared in hir chapitres folwinge.  de superbia. and thogh so be that no man can outrely telle the nombre of the twigges and of the harmes that cometh of pryde yet wol i shewe a partie of hem as ye shul understonde.  ther is inobedience avauntinge ipocrisie despyt arrogance impudence swellinge of herte insolence elacion impacience strif contumacie presumpcion irreverence pertinacie veyne glorie; and many another twig that i can nat declare.  inobedient is he that disobeyeth for despyt to the comandements of god and to hise sovereyns and to his goostly fader.  avauntour is he that bosteth of the harm or of the bountee that he hath doon.  ipocrite is he that hydeth to shewe him swiche as he is and sheweth him swiche as he noght is.  despitous is he that hath desdeyn of his neighebore that is to seyn of his evenecristene or hath despyt to doon that him oghte to do.  arrogant is he that thinketh that he hath thilke bountees in him that he hath noght or weneth that he sholde have hem by hise desertes; or elles he demeth that he be that he nis nat.  impudent is he that for his pride hath no shame of hise sinnes.  swellinge of herte is whan a man reioyseth him of harm that he hath doon.  insolent is he that despyseth in his iugement alle othere folk as to regard of his value and of his conning and of his speking and of his bering.  elacion is whan he ne may neither suffre to have maister ne felawe.  impacient is he that wol nat been ytaught ne undernome of his vyce and by stryf werreieth trouthe witingly and deffendeth his folye.  contumax is he that thurgh his indignacion is agayns everich auctoritee or power of hem that been hise sovereyns.  presumpcion is whan a man undertaketh an empryse that him oghte nat do or elles that he may nat do; and that is called surquidrie. irreverence is whan men do nat honour thereas hem oghte to doon and waiten to be reverenced.  pertinacie is whan man deffendeth his folye and trusteth to muchel in his owene wit.  veyne glorie is for to have pompe and delyt in his temporel hynesse and glorifie him in this worldly estaat.  ianglinge is whan men speken to muche biforn folk and clappen as a mille and taken no kepe what they seye.  and yet is ther a privee spece of pryde that waiteth first to be salewed er he wole salewe al be he lasse worth than that other is peraventure; and eek he waiteth or desyreth to sitte or elles to goon above him in the wey or kisse pax or been encensed or goon to offring biforn his neighebore  and swiche semblable thinges; agayns his duetee peraventure but that he hath his herte and his entente in swich a proud desyr to be magnifyed and honoured biforn the peple.  now been ther two maneres of pryde; that oon of hem is withinne the herte of man and that other is withoute.  of whiche soothly thise forseyde thinges and mo than i have seyd apertenen to pryde that is in the herte of man; and that othere speces of pryde been withoute.  but natheles that oon of thise speces of pryde is signe of that other right as the gaye leefsel atte taverne is signe of the wyn that is in the celer.  and this is in manye thinges: as in speche and contenaunce and in outrageous array of clothing;  for certes if ther ne hadde be no sinne in clothing crist wolde nat have noted and spoken of the clothing of thilke riche man in the gospel.  and as seith seint gregorie that precious clothing is coupable for the derthe of it and for his softenesse and for his strangenesse and degysinesse and for the superfluitee or for the inordinat scantnesse of it.  allas! may men nat seen as in oure dayes the sinful costlewe array of clothinge and namely in to muche superfluitee or elles in to desordinat scantnesse?  as to the firste sinne that is in superfluitee of clothinge which that maketh it so dere to harm of the peple;  nat only the cost of embroudinge the degyse endentinge or barringe oundinge palinge windinge or bendinge and semblable wast of clooth in vanitee;  but ther is also costlewe furringe in hir gounes so muche pounsoninge of chisels to maken holes so muche dagginge of sheres;  forthwith the superfluitee in lengthe of the forseide gounes trailinge in the dong and in the myre on horse and eek on fote as wel of man as of womman that al thilke trailing is verraily as in effect wasted consumed thredbare and roten with donge rather than it is yeven to the povre; to greet damage of the forseyde povre folk.  and that in sondry wyse: this is to seyn that the more that clooth is wasted the more it costeth to the peple for the scantnesse;  and fortherover if so be that they wolde yeven swich pounsoned and dagged clothing to the povre folk it is nat convenient to were for hir estaat ne suffisant to bete hir necessitee to kepe hem fro the distemperance of the firmament.  upon that other syde to speken of the horrible disordinat scantnesse of clothing as been thise cutted sloppes or hainselins that thurgh hir shortnesse ne covere nat the shameful membres of man to wikked entente.  allas! somme of hem shewen the boce of hir shap and the horrible swollen membres that semeth lyk the maladie of hirnia in the wrappinge of hir hoses;  and eek the buttokes of hem faren as it were the hindre part of a sheape in the fulle of the mone.  and moreover the wrecched swollen membres that they shewe thurgh the degysinge in departinge of hir hoses in whyt and reed semeth that half hir shameful privee membres weren flayn.  and if so be that they departen hire hoses in othere colours as is whyt and blak or whyt and blew or blak and reed and so forth;  thanne semeth it as by variance of colour that half the partie of hir privee membres were corrupt by the fyr of seint antony or by cancre or by other swich meschaunce.  of the hindre part of hir buttokes it is ful horrible for to see. for certes in that partie of hir body theras they purgen hir stinkinge ordure  that foule partie shewe they to the peple proudly in despyt of honestetee the which honestetee that iesu crist and hise freendes observede to shewen in hir lyve.  now as of the outrageous array of wommen god woot that though the visages of somme of hem seme ful chaast and debonaire yet notifie they in hir array of atyr likerousnesse and pryde.  i sey nat that honestetee in clothinge of man or womman is uncovenable but certes the superfluitee or disordinat scantitee of clothinge is reprevable.  also the sinne of aornement or of apparaille is in thinges that apertenen to rydinge as in to manye delicat horses that been holden for delyt that been so faire fatte and costlewe;  and also to many a vicious knave that is sustened by cause of hem; in to curious harneys as in sadeles in crouperes peytrels and brydles covered with precious clothing and riche barres and plates of gold and of silver.  for which god seith by zakarie the prophete i wol confounde the ryderes of swiche horses.  this folk taken litel reward of the rydinge of goddes sone of hevene and of his harneys whan he rood upon the asse and ne hadde noon other harneys but the povre clothes of hise disciples; ne we ne rede nat that evere he rood on other beest.  i speke this for the sinne of superfluitee and nat for reasonable honestetee whan reson it requyreth.  and forther certes pryde is greetly notified in holdinge of greet meinee whan they be of litel profit or of right no profit.  and namely whan that meinee is felonous and damageous to the peple by hardinesse of heigh lordshipe or by wey of offices.  for certes swiche lordes sellen thanne hir lordshipe to the devel of helle whanne they sustenen the wikkednesse of hir meinee.  or elles whan this folk of lowe degree as thilke that holden hostelries sustenen the thefte of hir hostilers and that is in many manere of deceites.  thilke manere of folk been the flyes that folwen the hony or elles the houndes that folwen the careyne. swiche forseyde folk stranglen spiritually hir lordshipes;  for which thus seith david the prophete wikked deeth mote come upon thilke lordshipes and god yeve that they mote descenden into helle al doun; for in hir houses been iniquitees and shrewednesses and nat god of hevene.  and certes butif they doon amendement right as god yaf his benison to laban by the service of iacob and to pharao by the service of joseph right so god wol yeve his malison to swiche lordshipes as sustenen the wikkednesse of hir servaunts butif they come to amendement.  pryde of the table appereth eek ful ofte; for certes riche men been cleped to festes and povre folk been put awey and rebuked.  also in excesse of diverse metes and drinkes; and namely swiche manere bake metes and dishmetes brenninge of wilde fyr and peynted and castelled with papir and semblable wast; so that it is abusion for to thinke.  and eek in to greet preciousnesse of vessel and curiositee of minstralcie by whiche a man is stired the more to delyces of luxurie  if so be that he sette his herte the lasse upon oure lord iesu crist certein it is a sinne; and certeinly the delyces mighte been so grete in this caas that man mighte lightly falle by hem into deedly sinne.  the especes that sourden of pryde soothly whan they sourden of malice ymagined avysed and forncast or elles of usage been deedly synnes it is no doute.  and whan they sourden by freletee unavysed sodeinly and sodeinly withdrawen ayein al been they grevouse sinnes i gesse that they ne been nat deedly.  now mighte men axe wherof that pryde sourdeth and springeth and i seye: somtyme it springeth of the goodes of nature and somtyme of the goodes of fortune and somtyme of the goodes of grace.  certes the goodes of nature stonden outher in goodes of body or in goodes of soule.  certes goodes of body been hele of body as strengthe delivernesse beautee gentrye franchise.  goodes of nature of the soule been good wit sharp understondynge subtil engin vertu naturel good memorie.  goodes of fortune been richesses highe degrees of lordshipes preisinges of the peple.  goodes of grace been science power to suffre spirituel travaille benignitee vertuous contemplacion withstondinge of temptacion and semblable thinges.  of whiche forseyde goodes certes it is a ful greet folye a man to pryden him in any of hem alle.  now as for to speken of goodes of nature god woot that somtyme we han hem in nature as muche to oure damage as to oure profit.  as for to speken of hele of body; certes it passeth ful lightly and eek it is ful ofte encheson of the siknesse of oure soule; for god woot the flesh is a ful greet enemy to the soule: and therfore the more that the body is hool the more be we in peril to falle.  eke for to pryde him in his strengthe of body it is an heigh folye; for certes the flesh coveiteth agayn the spirit and ay the more strong that the flesh is the sorier may the soule be:  and over al this strengthe of body and worldly hardinesse causeth ful ofte many a man to peril and meschaunce.  eek for to pryde him of his gentrye is ful greet folye; for ofte tyme the gentrye of the body binimeth the gentrye of the soule; and eek we ben alle of o fader and of o moder; and alle we been of o nature roten and corrupt both riche and povre.  for sothe o manere gentrye is for to preise that apparailleth mannes corage with vertues and moralitees and maketh him cristes child.  for truste wel that over what man sinne hath maistrie he is a verray cherl to sinne.  now been ther generale signes of gentilesse; as eschewinge of vyce and ribaudye and servage of sinne in word in werk and contenance;  and usinge vertu curteisye and clennesse and to be liberal that is to seyn large by mesure; for thilke that passeth mesure is folye and sinne.  another is to remembre him of bountee that he of other folk hath receyved.  another is to be benigne to hise goode subgetis; wherfore as seith senek ther is nothing more covenable to a man of heigh estaat than debonairetee and pitee.  and therfore thise flyes that men clepeth bees whan they maken hir king they chesen oon that hath no prikke wherwith he may stinge.  another is a man to have a noble herte and a diligent to attayne to heighe vertuouse thinges.  now certes a man to pryde him in the goodes of grace is eek an outrageous folye; for thilke yiftes of grace that sholde have turned him to goodnesse and to medicine turneth him to venim and to confusion as seith seint gregorie.  certes also whoso prydeth him in the goodes of fortune he is a ful greet fool; for somtyme is a man a greet lord by the morwe that is a caitif and a wrecche er it be night:  and somtyme the richesse of a man is cause of his deeth; somtyme the delyces of a man is cause of the grevous maladye thurgh which he dyeth.  certes the commendacion of the peple is somtyme ful fals and ful brotel for to triste; this day they preyse tomorwe they blame.  god woot desyr to have commendacion of the peple hath caused deeth to many a bisy man.  remedium contra peccatum superbie. now sith that so is that ye han understonde what is pryde and whiche been the speces of it and whennes pride sourdeth and springeth;  now shul ye understonde which is the remedie agayns the sinne of pryde and that is humilitee or mekenesse.  that is a vertu thurgh which a man hath verray knoweleche of himself and holdeth of himself no prys ne deyntee as in regard of hise desertes consideringe evere his freletee.  now been ther three maneres of humilitee; as humilitee in herte and another humilitee in his mouth; the thridde in hise werkes.  the humilitee in herte is in foure maneres: that oon is whan a man holdeth himself as noght worth biforn god of hevene. another is whan he ne despyseth noon other man.  the thridde is whan he rekketh nat thogh men holde him noght worth. the ferthe is whan he nis nat sory of his humiliacion.  also the humilitee of mouth is in foure thinges: in attempree speche and in humblesse of speche and whan he biknoweth with his owene mouth that he is swich as him thinketh that he is in his herte. another is whan he preiseth the bountee of another man and nothing therof amenuseth.  humilitee eek in werkes is in foure maneres: the firste is whan he putteth othere men biforn him. the seconde is to chese the loweste place overal. the thridde is gladly to assente to good conseil.  the ferthe is to stonde gladly to the award of hise sovereyns or of him that is in hyer degree; certein this is a greet werk of humilitee.  sequitur de inuidia. after pryde wol i speken of the foule sinne of envye which is as by the word of the philosophre sorwe of other mannes prosperitee; and after the word of seint augustin it is sorwe of other mannes wele and ioye of othere mennes harm.  this foule sinne is platly agayns the holy goost. albeit so that every sinne is agayns the holy goost yet nathelees for as muche as bountee aperteneth proprely to the holy goost and envye comth proprely of malice therfore it is proprely agayn the bountee of the holy goost.  now hath malice two speces that is to seyn hardnesse of herte in wikkednesse or elles the flesh of man is so blind that he considereth nat that he is in sinne or rekketh nat that he is in sinne; which is the hardnesse of the devel.  that other spece of malice is whan a man werreyeth trouthe whan he woot that it is trouthe. and eek whan he werreyeth the grace that god hath yeve to his neighebore; and al this is by envye.  certes thanne is envye the worste sinne that is. for soothly alle othere sinnes been somtyme only agayns o special vertu;  but certes envye is agayns alle vertues and agayns alle goodnesses; for it is sory of alle the bountees of his neighebore; and in this manere it is divers from alle othere sinnes.  for wel unnethe is ther any sinne that it ne hath som delyt in itself save only envye that evere hath in itself anguish and sorwe.  the speces of envye been thise: ther is first sorwe of other mannes goodnesse and of his prosperitee; and prosperitee is kindely matere of ioye; thanne is envye a sinne agayns kinde.  the seconde spece of envye is ioye of other mannes harm; and that is proprely lyk to the devel that evere reioyseth him of mannes harm.  of thise two speces comth bakbyting; and this sinne of bakbyting or detraccion hath certeine speces as thus. som man preiseth his neighebore by a wikke entente;  for he maketh alwey a wikked knotte atte laste ende. alwey he maketh a but atte laste ende that is digne of more blame than worth is al the preisinge.  the seconde spece is that if a man be good and dooth or seith a thing to good entente the bakbyter wol turne all thilke goodnesse upsodoun to his shrewed entente.  the thridde is to amenuse the bountee of his neighebore.  the fourthe spece of bakbyting is this; that if men speke goodnesse of a man thanne wol the bakbyter seyn parfey swich a man is yet bet than he; in dispreisinge of him that men preise.  the fifte spece is this; for to consente gladly and herkne gladly to the harm that men speke of other folk. this sinne is ful greet and ay encreseth after the wikked entente of the bakbyter.  after bakbyting cometh grucching or murmuracion; and somtyme it springeth of inpacience agayns god and somtyme agayns man.  agayns god it is whan a man gruccheth agayn the peynes of helle or agayns poverte or los of catel or agayn reyn or tempest; or elles gruccheth that shrewes han prosperitee or elles for that goode men han adversitee.  and alle thise thinges sholde men suffre paciently for they comen by the rightful iugement and ordinance of god.  somtyme comth grucching of avarice; as iudas grucched agayns the magdaleyne whan she enoynte the heved of oure lord iesu crist with hir precious oynement.  this maner murmure is swich as whan man gruccheth of goodnesse that himself dooth or that other folk doon of hir owene catel.  somtyme comth murmure of pryde; as whan simon the pharisee grucched agayn the magdaleyne whan she approched to iesu crist and weep at his feet for hir sinnes.  and somtyme grucching sourdeth of envye; whan men discovereth a mannes harm that was privee or bereth him on hond thing that is fals.  murmure eek is ofte amonges servaunts that grucchen whan hir sovereyns bidden hem doon leveful thinges;  and forasmuche as they dar nat openly withseye the comaundements of hir sovereyns yet wol they seyn harm and grucche and murmure prively for verray despyt;  whiche wordes men clepen the develes paternoster though so be that the devel ne hadde nevere paternoster but that lewed folk yeven it swich a name.  som tyme grucching comth of ire or prive hate that norisseth rancour in herte as afterward i shal declare.  thanne cometh eek bitternesse of herte; thurgh which bitternesse every good dede of his neighebor semeth to him bitter and unsavory.  thanne cometh discord that unbindeth alle manere of frendshipe. thanne comth scorninge as whan a man seketh occasioun to anoyen his neighebor al do he never so weel.  thanne comth accusinge as whan man seketh occasion to anoyen his neighebor which that is lyk to the craft of the devel that waiteth bothe night and day to accusen us alle.  thanne comth malignitee thurgh which a man anoyeth his neighebor prively if he may;  and if he noght may algate his wikked wil ne shal nat wante as for to brennen his hous prively or empoysone or sleen hise bestes and semblable thinges.  remedium contra peccatum inuidie. now wol i speke of the remedie agayns this foule sinne of envye. first is the love of god principal and loving of his neighebor as himself; for soothly that oon ne may nat been withoute that other.  and truste wel that in the name of thy neighebore thou shalt understonde the name of thy brother; for certes alle we have o fader fleshly and o moder that is to seyn adam and eve; and eek o fader espirituel and that is god of hevene.  thy neighebore artow holden for to love and wilne him alle goodnesse; and therfore seith god love thy neighebore as thyselve that is to seyn to salvacion bothe of lyf and of soule.  and moreover thou shalt love him in word and in benigne amonestinge and chastysinge; and conforten him in hise anoyes and preye for him with al thyn herte.  and in dede thou shall love him in swich wyse that thou shalt doon to him in charitee as thou woldest that it were doon to thyn owene persone.  and therfore thou ne shalt doon him no damage in wikked word ne harm in his body ne in his catel ne in his soule by entysing of wikked ensample.  thou shalt nat desyren his wyf ne none of hise thinges. understond eek that in the name of neighebor is comprehended his enemy.  certes man shal loven his enemy by the comandement of god; and soothly thy frend shaltow love in god.  i seye thyn enemy shaltow love for goddes sake by his comandement. for if it were reson that a man sholde haten his enemy for sothe god nolde nat receiven us to his love that been hise enemys.  agayns three manere of wronges that his enemy dooth to hym he shal doon three thinges as thus.  agayns hate and rancour of herte he shal love him in herte. agayns chyding and wikkede wordes he shal preye for his enemy. and agayn the wikked dede of his enemy he shal doon him bountee.  for crist seith loveth youre enemys and preyeth for hem that speke yow harm; and eek for hem that yow chacen and pursewen and doth bountee to hem that yow haten. lo thus comaundeth us oure lord iesu crist to do to oure enemys.  for soothly nature dryveth us to loven oure freendes and parfey oure enemys han more nede to love than oure freendes; and they that more nede have certes to hem shal men doon goodnesse;  and certes in thilke dede have we remembrance of the love of iesu crist that deyde for hise enemys.  and inasmuche as thilke love is the more grevous to perfourne insomuche is the more gretter the merite; and therfore the lovinge of oure enemy hath confounded the venim of the devel.  for right as the devel is disconfited by humilitee right so is he wounded to the deeth by love of oure enemy.  certes thanne is love the medicine that casteth out the venim of envye fro mannes herte.  the speces of this pas shullen be more largely in hir chapitres folwinge declared.  sequitur de ira. after envye wol i discryven the sinne of ire. for soothly whoso hath envye upon his neighebor anon he wole comunly finde him a matere of wratthe in word or in dede agayns him to whom he hath envye.  and as wel comth ire of pryde as of envye; for soothly he that is proude or envious is lightly wrooth.  this sinne of ire after the discryving of seint augustin is wikked wil to been avenged by word or by dede.  ire after the philosophre is the fervent blood of man yquiked in his herte thurgh which he wole harm to him that he hateth.  for certes the herte of man by eschaufinge and moevinge of his blood wexeth so trouble that he is out of alle iugement of resoun.  but ye shal understonde that ire is in two maneres; that oon of hem is good and that other is wikked.  the gode ire is by ialousye of goodnesse thurgh which a man is wrooth with wikkednesse and agayns wikkednesse; and therfore seith a wys man that ire is bet than pley.  this ire is with debonairetee and it is wrooth withouten bitternesse; nat wrooth agayns the man but wrooth with the misdede of the man; as seith the prophete david irascimini et nolite peccare.  now understondeth that wikked ire is in two maneres that is to seyn sodeyn ire or hastif ire withouten avisement and consentinge of resoun.  the mening and the sens of this is that the resoun of man ne consente nat to thilke sodeyn ire; and thanne it is venial.  another ire is ful wikked that comth of felonye of herte avysed and cast biforn; with wikked wil to do vengeance and therto his resoun consenteth; and soothly this is deedly sinne.  this ire is so displesant to god that it troubleth his hous and chaceth the holy goost out of mannes soule and wasteth and destroyeth the lyknesse of god that is to seyn the vertu that is in mannes soule;  and put in him the lyknesse of the devel and binimeth the man fro god that is his rightful lord.  this ire is a ful greet plesaunce to the devel; for it is the develes fourneys that is eschaufed with the fyr of helle.  for certes right so as fyr is more mighty to destroyen erthely thinges than any other element right so ire is mighty to destroyen alle spirituel thinges.  loke how that fyr of smale gledes that been almost dede under asshen wollen quike agayn whan they been touched with brimstoon; right so ire wol everemo quiken agayn whan it is touched by the pryde that is covered in mannes herte.  for certes fyr ne may nat comen out of nothing butif it were first in the same thing naturelly; as fyr is drawen out of flintes with steel.  and right so as pryde is ofte tyme matere of ire right so is rancour norice and keper of ire.  ther is a maner tree as seith seint isidre that whan men maken fyr of thilke tree and covere the coles of it with asshen soothly the fyr of it wol lasten al a yeer or more.  and right so fareth it of rancour; whan it is ones conceyved in the hertes of som men certein it wol lasten peraventure from oon estreday unto another estreday and more.  but certes thilke man is ful fer fro the mercy of god al thilke while.  in this forseyde develes fourneys ther forgen three shrewes: pryde that ay bloweth and encreseth the fyr by chydinge and wikked wordes.  thanne stant envye and holdeth the hote iren upon the herte of man with a peire of longe tonges of long rancour.  and thanne stant the sinne of contumelie or stryf and cheeste and batereth and forgeth by vileyns reprevinges.  certes this cursed sinne anoyeth bothe to the man himself and eek to his neighebor. for soothly almost al the harm that any man dooth to his neighebore comth of wratthe.  for certes outrageous wratthe doth al that evere the devel him comaundeth; for he ne spareth neither crist ne his swete mooder.  and in his outrageous anger and ire allas! allas! ful many oon at that tyme feleth in his herte ful wikkedly bothe of crist and of alle hise halwes.  is nat this a cursed vice? yis certes. allas! it binimeth from man his wit and his resoun and al his debonaire lyf espirituel that sholde kepen his soule.  certes it binimeth eek goddes due lordshipe and that is mannes soule and the love of hise neighebores. it stryveth eek alday agayn trouthe. it reveth him the quiete of his herte and subverteth his soule.  of ire comen thise stinkinge engendrures: first hate that is old wratthe; discord thurgh which a man forsaketh his olde freend that he hath loved ful longe.  and thanne cometh werre and every manere of wrong that man dooth to his neighebore in body or in catel.  of this cursed sinne of ire cometh eek manslaughtre. and understonde wel that homicyde that is manslaughtre is in dyverse wyse. som manere of homicyde is spirituel and som is bodily.  spirituel manslaughtre is in six thinges. first by hate; as seint iohn seith he that hateth his brother is homicyde.  homicyde is eek by bakbytinge; of whiche bakbyteres seith salomon that they han two swerdes with whiche they sleen hir neighebores. for soothly as wikke is to binime his good name as his lyf.  homicyde is eek in yevinge of wikked conseil by fraude; as for to yeven conseil to areysen wrongful custumes and taillages.  of whiche seith salomon leon rorynge and bere hongry been lyke to the cruel lordshipes in withholdinge or abregginge of the shepe or the hyre or of the wages of servaunts or elles in usure or in withdrawinge of the almesse of povre folk.  for which the wyse man seith fedeth him that almost dyeth for honger; for soothly butif thou fede him thou sleest him; and alle thise been deadly sinnes.  bodily manslaughtre is whan thow sleest him with thy tonge in other manere; as whan thou comandest to sleen a man or elles yevest him conseil to sleen a man.  manslaughtre in dede is in foure maneres. that oon is by lawe; right as a iustice dampneth him that is coupable to the deeth. but lat the iustice be war that he do it rightfully and that he do it nat for delyt to spille blood but for kepinge of rightwisenesse.  another homicyde is that is doon for necessitee as whan o man sleeth another in his defendaunt and that he ne may noon otherwise escape from his owene deeth.  but certeinly if he may escape withouten manslaughtre of his adversarie and sleeth him he doth sinne and he shal bere penance as for deedly sinne.  eek if a man by caas or aventure shete an arwe or caste a stoon with which he sleeth a man he is homicyde.  eek if a womman by necligence overlyeth hir child in hir sleping it is homicyde and deedly sinne.  eek whan man destourbeth concepcion of a child and maketh a womman outher bareyne by drinkinge venemouse herbes thurgh which she may nat conceyve or sleeth a child by drinkes wilfully or elles putteth certeine material thinges in hir secree places to slee the child;  or elles doth unkindely sinne by which man or womman shedeth hir nature in manere or in place theras a child may nat be conceived; or elles if a womman have conceyved and hurt hirself and sleeth the child yet is it homicyde.  what seye we eek of wommen that mordren hir children for drede of worldly shame? certes an horrible homicyde.  homicyde is eek if a man approcheth to a womman by desir of lecherye thurgh which the child is perissed or elles smyteth a womman witingly thurgh which she leseth hir child. alle thise been homicydes and horrible deedly sinnes.  yet comen ther of ire manye mo sinnes as wel in word as in thoght and in dede; as he that arretteth upon god or blameth god of thing of which he is himself gilty; or despyseth god and alle hise halwes as doon thise cursede hasardours in diverse contrees.  this cursed sinne doon they whan they felen in hir hertes ful wikkedly of god and of hise halwes.  also whan they treten unreverently the sacrement of the auter thilke sinne is so greet that unnethe may it been relesed but that the mercy of god passeth alle hise werkes; it is so greet and he so benigne.  thanne comth of ire attry angre; whan a man is sharply amonested in his shrifte to forleten his sinne  than wole he be angry and answeren hokerly and angrily and deffenden or excusen his sinne by unstedefastnesse of his flesh; or elles he dide it for to holde companye with hise felawes or elles he seith the fend entyced him;  or elles he dide it for his youthe or elles his complexioun is so corageous that he may nat forbere; or elles it is his destinee as he seith unto a certein age; or elles he seith it cometh him of gentillesse of hise auncestres; and semblable thinges.  alle this manere of folk so wrappen hem in hir sinnes that they ne wol nat delivere hemself. for soothly no wight that excuseth him wilfully of his sinne may nat been delivered of his sinne til that he mekely biknoweth his sinne.  after this thanne cometh swering that is expres agayn the comandement of god; and this bifalleth ofte of anger and of ire.  god seith: thou shalt nat take the name of thy lord god in veyn or in ydel. also oure lord iesu crist seith by the word of seint mathew: nolite iurare omnino:  ne wol ye nat swere in alle manere; neither by hevene for it is goddes trone; ne by erthe for it is the bench of his feet; ne by ierusalem for it is the citee of a greet king; ne by thyn heed for thou mayst nat make an heer whyt ne blak.  but seyeth by youre word ye ye and nay nay; and what that is more it is of yvel seith crist.  for cristes sake ne swereth nat so sinfully in dismembringe of crist by soule herte bones and body. for certes it semeth that ye thinke that the cursede iewes ne dismembred nat ynough the preciouse persone of crist but ye dismembre him more.  and if so be that the lawe compelle yow to swere thanne rule yow after the lawe of god in youre swering as seith ieremye quarto capitulo iurabis in veritate in iudido et in iustida: thou shalt kepe three condicions; thou shalt swere in trouthe in doom and in rightwisnesse.  this is to seyn thou shalt swere sooth; for every lesinge is agayns crist. for crist is verray trouthe. and think wel this that every greet swerere nat compelled lawefully to swere the wounde shal nat departe from his hous whyl he useth swich unleveful swering.  thou shalt sweren eek in doom whan thou art constreyned by thy domesman to witnessen the trouthe.  eek thou shalt nat swere for envye ne for favour ne for mede but for rightwisnesse; for declaracioun of it to the worship of god and helping of thyne evenecristene.  and therfore every man that taketh goddes name in ydel or falsly swereth with his mouth or elles taketh on him the name of crist to be called a cristene man and liveth agayns cristes livinge and his techinge alle they taken goddes name in ydel.  loke eek what seint peter seith actuum quarto capitulo non est aliud nomen sub celo c. ther nis noon other name seith seint peter under hevene yeven to men in which they mowe be saved; that is to seyn but the name of iesu crist.  take kepe eek how that the precious name of crist as seith seint paul ad philipenses secundo in nomine iesu c.: that in the name of iesu every knee of hevenely creatures or erthely or of helle sholden bowe; for it is so heigh and so worshipful that the cursede feend in helle sholde tremblen to heren it ynempned.  thanne semeth it that men that sweren so horribly by his blessed name that they despyse him more boldely than dide the cursede iewes or elles the devel that trembleth whan he hereth his name.  now certes sith that swering butif it be lawefully doon is so heighly deffended muche worse is forswering falsly and yet nedelees.  what seye we eek of hem that delyten hem in swering and holden it a gentrie or a manly dede to swere grete othes? and what of hem that of verray usage ne cesse nat to swere grete othes al be the cause nat worth a straw? certes this is horrible sinne.  sweringe sodeynly withoute avysement is eek a sinne.  but lat us go now to thilke horrible swering of adiuracioun and coniuracioun as doon thise false enchauntours or nigromanciens in bacins ful of water or in a bright swerd in a cercle or in a fyr or in a shulderboon of a sheep.  i can nat seye but that they doon cursedly and damnably agayns crist and al the feith of holy chirche.  what seye we of hem that bileven in divynailes as by flight or by noyse of briddes or of bestes or by sort by geomancie by dremes by chirkinge of dores or crakkinge of houses by gnawynge of rattes and swich manere wrecchednesse?  certes al this thing is deffended by god and by al holy chirche. for which they been acursed til they come to amendement that on swich filthe setten hir bileve.  charmes for woundes or maladye of men or of bestes if they taken any effect it may be peraventure that god suffreth it for folk sholden yeve the more feith and reverence to his name.  now wol i speken of lesinges which generally is fals significacioun of word in entente to deceyven his evenecristene.  som lesinge is of which ther comth noon avantage to no wight: and som lesinge turneth to the ese or profit of o man and to disese and damage of another man.  another lesinge is for to saven his lyf or his catel. another lesinge comth of delyt for to lye in which delyt they wol forge a long tale and peynten it with alle circumstaunces where al the ground of the tale is fals.  som lesinge comth for he wole sustene his word; and som lesinge comth of recchelesnesse withouten avysement; and semblable thinges.  lat us now touche the vyce of flateringe which ne comth nat gladly but for drede or for coveitise.  flaterye is generally wrongful preisinge. flatereres been the develes norices that norissen hise children with milk of losengerie.  for sothe salomon seith that flaterie is wors than detraccioun. for somtyme detraccion maketh an hautein man be the more humble for he dredeth detraccion; but certes flaterye that maketh a man to enhauncen his herte and his contenaunce.  flatereres been the develes enchauntours; for they make a man to wene of himself be lyk that he nis nat lyk.  they been lyk to iudas that bitraysed god; and thise flatereres bitraysen a man to sellen him to his enemy that is to the devel.  flatereres been the develes chapelleyns that singen evere placebo.  i rekene flaterye in the vyces of ire; for ofte tyme if o man be wrooth with another thanne wol he flatere som wight to sustene him in his querele.  speke we now of swich cursinge as comth of irous herte. malisoun generally may be seyd every maner power or harm. swich cursinge bireveth man fro the regne of god as seith seint paul.  and ofte tyme swich cursinge wrongfully retorneth agayn to him that curseth as a brid that retorneth agayn to his owene nest.  and over alle thing men oghten eschewe to cursen hir children and yeven to the devel hir engendrure as ferforth as in hem is; certes it is greet peril and greet sinne.  lat us thanne speken of chydinge and reproche whiche been ful grete woundes in mannes herte; for they unsowen the semes of frendshipe in mannes herte.  for certes unnethes may a man pleynly been accorded with him that hath him openly revyled and repreved in disclaundre. this is a ful grisly sinne as crist seith in the gospel.  and tak kepe now that he that repreveth his neighebor outher he repreveth him by som harm of peyne that he hath on his body as mesel croked harlot or by som sinne that he dooth.  now if he repreve him by harm of peyne thanne turneth the repreve to iesu crist; for peyne is sent by the rightwys sonde of god and by his suffrance be it meselrie or maheym or maladye.  and if he repreve him uncharitably of sinne as thou holour thou dronkelewe harlot and so forth; thanne aperteneth that to the reioysinge of the devel that evere hath ioye that men doon sinne.  and certes chydinge may nat come but out of a vileyns herte. for after the habundance of the herte speketh the mouth ful ofte.  and ye shul understonde that loke by any wey whan any man shal chastyse another that he be war from chydinge or reprevinge. for trewely but he be war he may ful lightly quiken the fyr of angre and of wratthe which that he sholde quenche and peraventure sleeth him which that he mighte chastyse with benignitee.  for as seith salomon the amiable tonge is the tree of lyf that is to seyn of lyf espirituel: and sothly a deslavee tonge sleeth the spirites of him that repreveth and eek of him that is repreved.  lo what seith seint augustin: ther is nothing so lyk the develes child as he that ofte chydeth. seint paul seith eek: i servant of god bihove nat to chyde.  and how that chydinge be a vileyns thing bitwixe alle manere folk yet it is certes most uncovenable bitwixe a man and his wyf; for there is nevere reste. and therfore seith salomon an hous that is uncovered and droppinge and a chydinge wyf been lyke.  a man that is in a droppinge hous in many places though he eschewe the droppinge in o place it droppeth on him in another place; so fareth it by a chydinge wyf. but she chyde him in o place she wol chyde him in another.  and therfore bettre is a morsel of breed with ioye than an hous ful of delyces with chydinge seith salomon.  seint paul seith: o ye wommen be ye subgetes to youre housbondes as bihoveth in god; and ye men loveth youre wyves. ad colossenses tertio.  afterward speke we of scorninge which is a wikked sinne; and namely whan he scorneth a man for hise gode werkes.  for certes swiche scorneres faren lyk the foule tode that may nat endure to smelle the sote savour of the vyne whanne it florissheth.  thise scorneres been parting felawes with the devel; for they han ioye whan the devel winneth and sorwe whan he leseth.  they been adversaries of iesu crist; for they haten that he loveth that is to seyn salvacion of soule.  speke we now of wikked conseil; for he that wikked conseil yeveth is a traytour. for he deceyveth him that trusteth in him ut achitofel ad absolonem. but natheless yet is his wikked conseil first agayn himself.  for as seith the wyse man every fals livinge hath this propertee in himself that he that wole anoye another man he anoyeth first himself.  and men shul understonde that man shal nat taken his conseil of fals folk ne of angry folk or grevous folk ne of folk that loven specially to muchel hir owene profit ne to muche worldly folk namely in conseilinge of soules.  now comth the sinne of hem that sowen and maken discord amonges folk which is a sinne that crist hateth outrely; and no wonder is. for he deyde for to make concord.  and more shame do they to crist than dide they that him crucifyede; for god loveth bettre that frendshipe be amonges folk than he dide his owene body the which that he yaf for unitee. therfore been they lykned to the devel that evere been aboute to maken discord.  now comth the sinne of double tonge; swiche as speken faire biforn folk and wikkedly bihinde; or elles they maken semblant as though they speke of good entencioun or elles in game and pley and yet they speke of wikked entente.  now comth biwreying of conseil thurgh which a man is defamed; certes unnethe may he restore the damage.  now comth manace that is an open folye; for he that ofte manaceth he threteth more than he may perfourne ful ofte tyme.  now cometh ydel wordes that is withouten profit of him that speketh tho wordes and eek of him that herkneth tho wordes. or elles ydel wordes been tho that been nedelees or withouten entente of naturel profit.  and albeit that ydel wordes been som tyme venial sinne yet sholde men douten hem; for we shul yeve rekeninge of hem bifore god.  now comth ianglinge that may nat been withoute sinne. and as seith salomon it is a sinne of apert folye.  and therfore a philosophre seyde whan men axed him how that men sholde plese the peple; and he answerde do many gode werkes and spek fewe iangles.  after this comth the sinne of iaperes that been the develes apes; for they maken folk to laughe at hir iaperie as folk doon at the gaudes of an ape. swiche iaperes deffendeth seint paul.  loke how that vertuouse wordes and holy conforten hem that travaillen in the service of crist; right so conforten the vileyns wordes and knakkes of iaperis hem that travaillen in the service of the devel.  thise been the sinnes that comen of the tonge that comen of ire and of othere sinnes mo.  sequitur remedium contra peccatum ire. the remedye agayns ire is a vertu that men clepen mansuetude that is debonairetee; and eek another vertu that men callen pacience or suffrance.  debonairetee withdraweth and refreyneth the stiringes and the moevynges of mannes corage in his herte in swich manere that they ne skippe nat out by angre ne by ire.  suffrance suffreth swetely alle the anoyaunces and the wronges that men doon to man outward.  seint ierome seith thus of debonairetee that it doth noon harm to no wight ne seith; ne for noon harm that men doon or seyn he ne eschaufeth nat agayns his resoun.  this vertu somtyme comth of nature; for as seith the philosophre a man is a quik thing by nature debonaire and tretable to goodnesse; but whan debonairetee is enformed of grace thanne is it the more worth.  pacience that is another remedye agayns ire is a vertu that suffreth swetely every mannes goodnesse and is nat wrooth for noon harm that is doon to him.  the philosophre seith that pacience is thilke vertu that suffreth debonairely alle the outrages of adversitee and every wikked word.  this vertu maketh a man lyk to god and maketh him goddes owene dere child as seith crist. this vertu disconfiteth thyn enemy. and therfore seith the wyse man if thou wolt venquisse thyn enemy lerne to suffre.  and thou shalt understonde that man suffreth foure manere of grevances in outward thinges agayns the whiche foure he moot have foure manere of paciences.  the firste grevance is of wikkede wordes; thilke suffrede iesu crist withouten grucching ful paciently whan the iewes despysed and repreved him ful ofte.  suffre thou therfore paciently; for the wyse man seith: if thou stryve with a fool though the fool be wrooth or though he laughe algate thou shalt have no reste.  that other grevance outward is to have damage of thy catel. theragayns suffred crist ful paciently whan he was despoyled of al that he hadde in this lyf and that nas but hise clothes.  the thridde grevance is a man to have harm in his body. that suffred crist ful paciently in al his passioun.  the fourthe grevance is in outrageous labour in werkes. wherfore i seye that folk that maken hir servants to travaillen to grevously or out of tyme as on halydayes soothly they do greet sinne.  heeragayns suffred crist ful paciently and taughte us pacience whan he bar upon his blissed shulder the croys upon which he sholde suffren despitous deeth.  heer may men lerne to be pacient; for certes noght only cristen men been pacient for love of iesu crist and for guerdoun of the blisful lyf that is perdurable; but certes the olde payens that nevere were cristene commendeden and useden the vertu of pacience.  a philosophre upon a tyme that wolde have beten his disciple for his grete trespas for which he was greetly amoeved and broghte a yerde to scourge the child;  and whan this child saugh the yerde he seyde to his maister what thenke ye to do? i wol bete thee quod the maister for thy correccion.  for sothe quod the child ye oghten first correcte youreself that han lost al youre pacience for the gilt of a child.  for sothe quod the maister al wepinge thou seyst sooth; have thou the yerde my dere sone and correcte me for myn inpacience.  of pacience comth obedience thurgh which a man is obedient to crist and to alle hem to whiche he oghte to been obedient in crist.  and understond wel that obedience is perfit whan that a man doth gladly and hastily with good herte entierly al that he sholde do.  obedience generally is to perfourne the doctrine of god and of his sovereyns to whiche him oghte to ben obeisaunt in alle rightwysnesse.  sequitur de accidia. after the sinnes of envie and of ire now wol i speken of the sinne of accidie. for envye blindeth the herte of a man and ire troubleth a man; and accidie maketh him hevy thoghtful and wrawe.  envye and ire maken bitternesse in herte; which bitternesse is moder of accidie and binimeth him the love of alle goodnesse. thanne is accidie the anguissh of a trouble herte; and seint augustin seith: it is anoy of goodnesse and ioye of harm.  certes this is a dampnable sinne; for it doth wrong to iesu crist inasmuche as it binimeth the service that men oghte doon to crist with alle diligence as seith salomon.  but accidie dooth no swich diligence; he dooth alle thing with anoy and with wrawnesse slaknesse and excusacioun and with ydelnesse and unlust; for which the book seith: acursed be he that doth the service of god necligently.  thanne is accidie enemy to everich estaat of man; for certes the estaat of man is in three maneres.  outher it is thestaat of innocence as was thestaat of adam biforn that he fil into sinne; in which estaat he was holden to wirche as in heryinge and adouringe of god.  another estaat is the estaat of sinful men in which estaat men been holden to laboure in preyinge to god for amendement of hir sinnes and that he wole graunte hem to arysen out of hir sinnes.  another estaat is thestaat of grace in which estaat he is holden to werkes of penitence; and certes to alle thise thinges is accidie enemy and contrarie. for he loveth no bisinesse at al.  now certes this foule sinne accidie is eek a ful greet enemy to the lyflode of the body; for it ne hath no purveaunce agayn temporel necessitee; for it forsleweth and forsluggeth and destroyeth alle goodes temporeles by reccheleesnesse.  the fourthe thinge is that accidie is lyk to hem that been in the peyne of helle bycause of hir slouthe and of hir hevinesse; for they that been dampned been so bounde that they ne may neither wel do ne wel thinke.  of accidie comth first that a man is anoyed and encombred for to doon any goodnesse and maketh that god hath abhominacion of swich accidie as seith seint iohan.  now comth slouthe that wol nat suffre noon hardnesse ne no penaunce. for soothly slouthe is so tendre and so delicat as seith salomon that he wol nat suffre noon hardnesse ne penaunce and therfore he shendeth al that he dooth.  agayns this rotenherted sinne of accidie and slouthe sholde men exercise hemself to doon gode werkes and manly and vertuously cacchen corage wel to doon; thinkinge that oure lord iesu crist quyteth every good dede be it never so lyte.  usage of labour is a greet thing; for it maketh as seith seint bernard the laborer to have stronge armes and harde sinwes; and slouthe maketh hem feble and tendre.  thanne comth drede to biginne to werke any gode werkes; for certes he that is enclyned to sinne him thinketh it is so greet an empryse for to undertake to doon werkes of goodnesse  and casteth in his herte that the circumstaunces of goodnesse been so grevouse and so chargeaunt for to suffre that he dar nat undertake to do werkes of goodnesse as seith seint gregorie.  now comth wanhope that is despeir of the mercy of god that comth somtyme of to muche outrageous sorwe and somtyme of to muche drede; imagininge that he hath doon so muche sinne that it wol nat availlen him though he wolde repenten him and forsake sinne:  thurgh which despeir or drede he abaundoneth al his herte to every maner sinne as seith seint augustin.  which dampnable sinne if that it continue unto his ende it is cleped sinning in the holy gost.  this horrible sinne is so perilous that he that is despeired ther nis no felonye ne no sinne that he douteth for to do; as shewed wel by iudas.  certes aboven alle sinnes thanne is this sinne most displesant to crist and most adversarie.  soothly he that despeireth him is lyk the coward champioun recreant that seith creant withoute nede. allas! allas! nedeles is he recreant and nedeles despeired.  certes the mercy of god is evere redy to every penitent and is aboven alle hise werkes.  allas! can nat a man bithinke him on the gospel of seint luk . whereas crist seith that as wel shal ther be ioye in hevene upon a sinful man that doth penitence as upon nynety and nyne rightful men that neden no penitence?  loke forther in the same gospel the ioye and the feste of the gode man that hadde lost his sone whan his sone with repentaunce was retourned to his fader.  can they nat remembren hem eek that as seith seint luk xxiii capitulo how that the theef that was hanged bisyde iesu crist seyde: lord remembre of me whan thou comest into thy regne?  for sothe seyde crist i seye to thee today shaltow been with me in paradys.  certes ther is noon so horrible sinne of man that it ne may in his lyf be destroyed by penitence thurgh vertu of the passion and of the deeth of crist.  allas! what nedeth man thanne to been despeired sith that his mercy so redy is and large? axe and have.  thanne cometh sompnolence that is sluggy slombringe which maketh a man be hevy and dul in body and in soule; and this sinne comth of slouthe.  and certes the tyme that by wey of resoun men sholde nat slepe that is by the morwe; butif ther were cause resonable.  for soothly the morwetyde is most covenable a man to seye his preyeres and for to thinken on god and for to honoure god and to yeven almesse to the povre that first cometh in the name of crist.  lo! what seith salomon: whoso wolde by the morwe awaken and seke me he shal finde.  thanne cometh necligence or recchelesnesse that rekketh of nothing. and how that ignoraunce be moder of alle harm certes necligence is the norice.  necligence ne doth no fors whan he shal doon a thing whether he do it weel or baddely.  of the remedie of thise two sinnes as seith the wyse man that he that dredeth god he spareth nat to doon that him oghte doon.  and he that loveth god he wol doon diligence to plese god by his werkes and abaundone himself with al his might wel for to doon.  thanne comth ydelnesse that is the yate of alle harmes. an ydel man is lyk to a place that hath no walles; the develes may entre on every syde and sheten at him at discovert by temptacion on every syde.  this ydelnesse is the thurrok of alle wikked and vileyns thoghtes and of alle iangles trufles and of alle ordure.  certes the hevene is yeven to hem that wol labouren and nat to ydel folk. eek david seith: that they ne been nat in the labour of men ne they shul nat been whipped with men that is to seyn in purgatorie.  certes thanne semeth it they shul be tormented with the devel in helle butif they doon penitence.  thanne comth the sinne that men clepen tarditas as whan a man is to latrede or taryinge er he wole turne to god; and certes that is a greet folye. he is lyk to him that falleth in the dich and wol nat aryse.  and this vyce comth of a fals hope that he thinketh that he shal live longe; but that hope faileth ful ofte.  thanne comth lachesse; that is he that whan he biginneth any good werk anon he shal forleten it and stinten; as doon they that han any wight to governe and ne taken of him namore kepe anon as they finden any contrarie or any anoy.  thise been the newe shepherdes that leten hir sheep witingly go renne to the wolf that is in the breres or do no fors of hir owene governaunce.  of this comth poverte and destruccioun bothe of spirituel and temporel thinges. thanne comth a manere coldnesse that freseth al the herte of man.  thanne comth undevocioun thurgh which a man is so blent as seith seint bernard and hath swiche langour in soule that he may neither rede ne singe in holy chirche ne here ne thinke of no devocioun ne travaille with hise handes in no good werk that it nis him unsavory and al apalled.  thanne wexeth he slow and slombry and sone wol be wrooth and sone is enclyned to hate and to envye.  thanne comth the sinne of worldly sorwe swich as is cleped tristicia that sleeth man as seint paul seith.  for certes swich sorwe werketh to the deeth of the soule and of the body also; for therof comth that a man is anoyed of his owene lyf.  wherfore swich sorwe shorteth ful ofte the lyf of a man er that his tyme be come by wey of kinde.  remedium contra peccatum accidie. agayns this horrible sinne of accidie and the branches of the same ther is a vertu that is called fortitudo or strengthe; that is an affeccioun thurgh which a man despyseth anoyous thinges.  this vertu is so mighty and so vigorous that it dar withstonde mightily and wysely kepen himself fro perils that been wikked and wrastle agayn the assautes of the devel.  for it enhaunceth and enforceth the soule right as accidie abateth it and maketh it feble. for this fortitudo may endure by long suffraunce the travailles that been covenable.  this vertu hath manye speces; and the firste is cleped magnanimitee that is to seyn greet corage. for certes ther bihoveth greet corage agains accidie lest that it ne swolwe the soule by the sinne of sorwe or destroye it by wanhope.  this vertu maketh folk to undertake harde thinges and grevouse thinges by hir owene wil wysely and resonably.  and for as muchel as the devel fighteth agayns a man more by queyntise and by sleighte than by strengthe therfore men shal withstonden him by wit and by resoun and by discrecioun.  thanne arn ther the vertues of feith and hope in god and in hise seintes to acheve and acomplice the gode werkes in the whiche he purposeth fermely to continue.  thanne comth seuretee or sikernesse; and that is whan a man ne douteth no travaille in tyme cominge of the gode werkes that a man hath bigonne.  thanne comth magnificence that is to seyn whan a man dooth and perfourneth grete werkes of goodnesse that he hath bigonne; and that is the ende why that men sholde do gode werkes; for in the acomplissinge of grete goode werkes lyth the grete guerdoun.  thanne is ther constaunce that is stablenesse of corage; and this sholde been in herte by stedefast feith and in mouth and in beringe and in chere and in dede.  eke ther been mo speciale remedies agains accidie in diverse werkes and in consideracioun of the peynes of helle and of the ioyes of hevene and in trust of the grace of the holy goost that wole yeve him might to perfourne his gode entente.  sequitur de auaricia. after accidie wol i speke of avarice and of coveitise of which sinne seith seint paule that the rote of alle harmes is coveitise: ad timotheum sexto capitulo.  for soothly whan the herte of a man is confounded in itself and troubled and that the soule hath lost the confort of god thanne seketh he an ydel solas of worldly thinges.  avarice after the descripcion of seint augustin is likerousnesse in herte to have erthely thinges.  som other folk seyn that avarice is for to purchacen manye erthely thinges and nothing yeve to hem that han nede.  and understond that avarice ne stant nat only in lond ne catel but somtyme in science and in glorie and in every manere of outrageous thing is avarice and coveitise.  and the difference bitwixe avarice and coveitise is this. coveitise is for to coveite swiche thinges as thou hast nat; and avarice is for to withholde and kepe swiche thinges as thou hast withoute rightful nede.  soothly this avarice is a sinne that is ful dampnable; for al holy writ curseth it and speketh agayns that vyce; for it dooth wrong to iesu crist.  for it bireveth him the love that men to him owen and turneth it bakward agayns alle resoun;  and maketh that the avaricious man hath more hope in his catel than in iesu crist and dooth more observance in kepinge of his tresor than he dooth to service of iesu crist.  and therfore seith seint paul ad ephesios quinto that an avaricious man is in the thraldom of ydolatrie.  what difference is bitwixe an ydolastre and an avaricious man but that an ydolastre per aventure ne hath but o mawmet or two and the avaricious man hath manye? for certes every florin in his cofre is his mawmet.  and certes the sinne of mawmetrye is the firste thing that god deffended in the ten comaundments as bereth witnesse exodi capitulo xx:  thou shall have no false goddes bifore me ne thou shall make to thee no grave thing. thus is an avaricious man that loveth his tresor biforn god an ydolastre  thurgh this cursed sinne of avarice. of coveitise comen thise harde lordshipes thurgh whiche men been distreyned by tailages custumes and cariages more than hir duetee or resoun is. and eek they taken of hir bondemen amerciments whiche mighten more resonably ben cleped extorcions than amerciments.  of whiche amerciments and raunsoninge of bondemen somme lordes stywardes seyn that it is rightful; forasmuche as a cherl hath no temporel thing that it ne is his lordes as they seyn.  but certes thise lordshipes doon wrong that bireven hir bondefolk thinges that they nevere yave hem: augustinus de civitate libro nono.  sooth is that the condicioun of thraldom and the firste cause of thraldom is for sinne; genesis quinto.  thus may ye seen that the gilt disserveth thraldom but nat nature.  wherfore thise lordes ne sholde nat muche glorifyen hem in hir lordshipes sith that by naturel condicion they been nat lordes of thralles; but for that thraldom comth first by the desert of sinne.  and fortherover theras the lawe seith that temporel godes of bondefolk been the godes of hir lordshipes ye that is for to understonde the godes of the emperour to deffenden hem in hir right but nat for to robben hem ne reven hem.  and therfore seith seneca: thy prudence sholde live benignely with thy thralles.  thilke that thou clepest thy thralles been goddes peple; for humble folk been cristes freendes; they been contubernial with the lord.  think eek that of swich seed as cherles springeth of swich seed springen lordes. as wel may the cherl be saved as the lord.  the same deeth that taketh the cherl swich deeth taketh the lord. wherfore i rede do right so with thy cherl as thou woldest that thy lord dide with thee if thou were in his plyt.  every sinful man is a cherl to sinne. i rede thee certes that thou lord werke in swiche wyse with thy cherles that they rather love thee than drede.  i woot wel ther is degree above degree as reson is; and skile it is that men do hir devoir theras it is due; but certes extorcions and despit of youre underlinges is dampnable.  and fortherover understand wel that thise conquerours or tiraunts maken ful ofte thralles of hem that been born of as royal blood as been they that hem conqueren.  this name of thraldom was nevere erst couth til that noe seyde that his sone canaan sholde be thral to hise bretheren for his sinne.  what seye we thanne of hem that pilen and doon extorcions to holy chirche? certes the swerd that men yeven first to a knight whan he is newe dubbed signifyeth that he sholde deffenden holy chirche and nat robben it ne pilen it; and who so dooth is traitour to crist.  and as seith seint augustin they been the develes wolves that stranglen the sheep of iesu crist; and doon worse than wolves.  for soothly whan the wolf hath ful his wombe he stinteth to strangle sheep. but soothly the pilours and destroyours of goddes holy chirche ne do nat so; for they ne stinte nevere to pile.  now as i have seyd sith so is that sinne was first cause of thraldom thanne is it thus; that thilke tyme that al this world was in sinne thanne was al this world in thraldom and subieccioun.  but certes sith the tyme of grace cam god ordeyned that som folk sholde be more heigh in estaat and in degree and som folk more lowe and that everich sholde be served in his estaat and in his degree.  and therfore in somme contrees ther they byen thralles whan they han turned hem to the feith they maken hir thralles free out of thraldom. and therfore certes the lord oweth to his man that the man oweth to his lord.  the pope calleth himself servant of the servaunts of god; but forasmuche as the estaat of holy chirche ne mighte nat han be ne the commune profit mighte nat han be kept ne pees and reste in erthe butif god hadde ordeyned that som men hadde hyer degree and som men lower:  therfore was sovereyntee ordeyned to kepe and mayntene and deffenden hir underlinges or hir subgets in resoun as ferforth as it lyth in hir power; and nat to destroyen hem ne confounde.  wherfore i seye that thilke lordes that been lyk wolves that devouren the possessiouns or the catel of povre folk wrongfully withouten mercy or mesure  they shul receyven by the same mesure that they han mesured to povre folk the mercy of iesu crist butif it be amended.  now comth deceite bitwixe marchant and marchant. and thow shalt understonde that marchandyse is in two maneres; that oon is bodily and that other is goostly. that oon is honeste and leveful and that other is deshoneste and unleveful.  of thilke bodily marchandyse that is leveful and honeste is this; that thereas god hath ordeyned that a regne or a contree is suffisaunt to himself thanne is it honeste and leveful that of habundaunce of this contree that men helpe another contree that is more nedy.  and therfore ther mote been marchants to bringen fro that o contree to that other hire marchandyses.  that other marchandise that men haunten with fraude and trecherie and deceite with lesinges and false othes is cursed and dampnable.  espirituel marchandyse is proprely symonye that is ententif desyr to byen thing espirituel that is thing that aperteneth to the seintuarie of god and to cure of the soule.  this desyr if so be that a man do his diligence to parfournen it albeit that his desyr ne take noon effect yet is it to him a deedly sinne; and if he be ordred he is irreguler.  certes symonye is cleped of symon magus that wolde han boght for temporel catel the yifte that god hadde yeven by the holy goost to seint peter and to the apostles.  and therfore understond that bothe he that selleth and he that byeth thinges espirituels been cleped symonials; be it by catel be it by procuringe or by fleshly preyere of hise freendes fleshly freendes or espirituel freendes.  fleshly in two maneres; as by kinrede or othere freendes. soothly if they praye for him that is nat worthy and able it is symonye if he take the benefice; and if he be worthy and able ther nis noon.  that other manere is whan a man or womman preyen for folk to avauncen hem only for wikked fleshly affeccioun that they have unto the persone; and that is foul symonye.  but certes in service for which men yeven thinges espirituels unto hir servants it moot been understonde that the service moot been honeste and elles nat; and eek that it be withouten bargayninge and that the persone be able.  for as seith seint damasie alle the sinnes of the world at regard of this sinne am as thing of noght; for it is the gretteste sinne that may be after the sinne of lucifer and antecrist.  for by this sinne god forleseth the chirche and the soule that he boghte with his precious blood by hem that yeven chirches to hem that been nat digne.  for they putten in theves that stelen the soules of iesu christ and destroyen his patrimoine.  by swiche undigne preestes and curates han lewed men the lasse reverence of the sacraments of holy chirche; and swiche yeveres of chirches putten out the children of crist and putten into the chirche the develes owene sone.  they sellen the soules that lambes sholde kepen to the wolf that strangleth hem. and therfore shul they nevere han part of the pasture of lambes that is the blisse of hevene.  now comth hasardrye with hise apurtenaunces as tables and rafles; of which comth deceite false othes chydinges and alle ravines blaspheminge and reneyinge of god and hate of hise neighebores wast of godes misspendinge of tyme and somtyme manslaughtre.  certes hasardours ne mowe nat been withouten greet sinne whyles they haunte that craft.  of avarice comen eek lesinges thefte fals witnesse and false othes. and ye shul understonde that thise been grete sinnes and expres agayn the comaundements of god as i have seyd.  fals witnesse is in word and eek in dede. in word as for to bireve thy neighebores goode name by thy fals witnessing or bireven him his catel or his heritage by thy fals witnessing; whan thou for ire or for mede or for envye berest fals witnesse or accusest him or excusest him by thy fals witnesse or elles excusest thyself falsly.  ware yow questemongeres and notaries! certes for fals witnessing was susanna in ful gret sorwe and peyne and many another mo.  the sinne of thefte is eek expres agayns goddes heste and that in two maneres corporel and espirituel.  corporel as for to take thy neighebores catel agayn his wil be it by force or by sleighte be it by met or by mesure.  by steling eek of false enditements upon him and in borwinge of thy neighebores catel in entente nevere to payen it agayn and semblable thinges.  espirituel thefte is sacrilege that is to seyn hurtinge of holy thinges or of thinges sacred to crist in two maneres; by reson of the holy place as chirches or chirchehawes  for which every vileyns sinne that men doon in swiche places may be cleped sacrilege or every violence in the semblable places. also they that withdrawen falsly the rightes that longen to holy chirche.  and pleynly and generally sacrilege is to reven holy thing fro holy place or unholy thing out of holy place or holy thing out of unholy place.  relevacio contra peccatum avaricie. now shul ye understonde that the relevinge of avarice is misericorde and pitee largely taken. and men mighten axe why that misericorde and pitee is relevinge of avarice?  certes the avaricious man sheweth no pitee ne misericorde to the nedeful man; for he delyteth him in the kepinge of his tresor and nat in the rescowinge ne relevinge of his evenecristene. and therfore fore speke i first of misericorde.  thanne is misericorde as seith the philosophre a vertu by which the corage of man is stired by the misese of him that is misesed.  upon which misericorde folweth pitee in parfourninge of charitable werkes of misericorde.  and certes thise thinges moeven a man to misericorde of iesu crist that he yaf himself for oure gilt and suffred deeth for misericorde and forgaf us oure originale sinnes;  and therby relessed us fro the peynes of helle and amenused the peynes of purgatorie by penitence and yeveth grace wel to do and atte laste the blisse of hevene.  the speces of misericorde been as for to lene and for to yeve and to foryeven and relesse and for to han pitee in herte and compassioun of the meschief of his evenecristene and eek to chastyse there as nede is.  another manere of remedie agayns avarice is resonable largesse; but soothly here bihoveth the consideracioun of the grace of iesu crist and of hise temporel goodes and eek of the godes perdurables that crist yaf to us;  and to han remembrance of the deeth that he shal receyve he noot whanne where ne how; and eek that he shal forgon al that he hath save only that he hath despended in gode werkes.  but forasmuche as som folk been unmesurable men oghten eschue foollargesse that men clepen wast.  certes he that is foollarge ne yeveth nat his catel but he leseth his catel. soothly what thing that he yeveth for veyne glorie as to minstrals and to folk for to beren his renoun in the world he hath sinne therof and noon almesse.  certes he leseth foule his good that ne seketh with the yifte of his good nothing but sinne.  he is lyk to an hors that seketh rather to drinken drovy or trouble water than for to drinken water of the clere welle.  and forasmuchel as they yeven ther as they sholde nat yeven to hem aperteneth thilke malisoun that crist shal yeven at the day of dome to hem that shullen been dampned.  sequitur de gula. after avarice comth glotonye which is expres eek agayn the comandement of god. glotonye is unmesurable appetyt to ete or to drinke or elles to doon ynogh to the unmesurable appetyt and desordeynce coveityse to eten or to drinke.  this sinne corrumped al this world as is wel shewed in the sinne of adam and of eve. loke eek what seith seint paul of glotonye.  manye seith seint paul goon of whiche i have ofte seyd to yow and now i seye it wepinge that they been the enemys of the croys of crist; of whiche the ende is deeth and of whiche hir wombe is hir god and hir glorie in confusioun of hem that so saveren erthely thinges.  he that is usaunt to this sinne of glotonye he ne may no sinne withstonde. he moot been in servage of alle vyces for it is the develes hord ther he hydeth him and resteth.  this sinne hath manye speces. the firste is dronkenesse that is the horrible sepulture of mannes resoun; and therfore whan a man is dronken he hath lost his resoun; and this is deedly sinne.  but soothly whan that a man is nat wont to strong drinke and peraventure ne knoweth nat the strengthe of the drinke or hath feblesse in his heed or hath travailed thurgh which he drinketh the more al be he sodeynly caught with drinke it is no deedly sinne but venial.  the seconde spece of glotonye is that the spirit of a man wexeth al trouble; for dronkenesse bireveth him the discrecioun of his wit.  the thridde spece of glotonye is whan a man devoureth his mete and hath no rightful manere of etinge.  the fourthe is whan thurgh the grete habundaunce of his mete the humours in his body been destempred.  the fifthe is foryetelnesse by to muchel drinkinge; for which somtyme a man foryeteth er the morwe what he dide at even or on the night biforn.  in other manere been distinct the speces of glotonye after seint gregorie. the firste is for to ete biforn tyme to ete. the seconde is whan a man get him to delicat mete or drinke.  the thridde is whan men taken to muche over mesure. the fourthe is curiositee with greet entente to maken and apparaillen his mete. the fifthe is for to eten to gredily.  thise been the fyve fingres of the develes hand by whiche he draweth folk to sinne.  remedium contra peccatum gule. agayns glotonye is the remedie abstinence as seith galien; but that holde i nat meritorie if he do it only for the hele of his body. seint augustin wole that abstinence be doon for vertu and with pacience.  abstinence he seith is litel worth but if a man have good wil therto and but it be enforced by pacience and by charitee and that men doon it for godes sake and in hope to have the blisse of hevene.  the felawes of abstinence been attemperaunce that holdeth the mene in alle thinges: eek shame that eschueth alle deshonestee: suffisance that seketh no riche metes ne drinkes ne dooth no fors of to outrageous apparailinge of mete.  mesure also that restreyneth by resoun the deslavee appetyt of etinge: sobrenesse also that restreyneth the outrage of drinke:  sparinge also that restreyneth the delicat ese to sitte longe at his mete and softely; wherfore som folk stonden of hir owene wil to eten at the lasse leyser.  sequitur de luxuria. after glotonye thanne comth lecherie; for thise two sinnes been so ny cosins that ofte tyme they wol nat departe.  god woot this sinne is ful displesaunt thing to god; for he seyde himself do no lecherie. and therfore he putte grete peynes agayns this sinne in the olde lawe.  if womman thral were taken in this sinne she sholde be beten with staves to the deeth. and if she were a gentil womman she sholde be slayn with stones. and if she were a bisshoppes doghter she sholde been brent by goddes comandement.  forther over by the sinne of lecherie god dreynte al the world at the diluge. and after that he brente fyve citees with thonderleyt and sank hem into helle.  now lat us speke thanne of thilke stinkinge sinne of lecherie that men clepe avoutrie of wedded folk that is to seyn if that oon of hem be wedded or elles bothe.  seint iohn seith that avoutiers shullen been in helle in a stank brenninge of fyr and of brimston; in fyr for the lecherie; in brimston for the stink of hir ordure.  certes the brekinge of this sacrement is an horrible thing; it was maked of god himself in paradys and confermed by iesu crist as witnesseth seint mathew in the gospel: a man shal lete fader and moder and taken him to his wyf and they shullen be two in o flesh.  this sacrement bitokneth the knittinge togidre of crist and of holy chirche.  and nat only that god forbad avoutrie in dede but eek he comanded that thou sholdest nat coveite thy neighebores wyf.  in this heeste seith seint augustin is forboden alle manere coveitise to doon lecherie. lo what seith seint mathew in the gospel: that whoso seeth a womman to coveitise of his lust he hath doon lecherie with hir in his herte.  here may ye seen that nat only the dede of this sinne is forboden but eek the desyr to doon that sinne.  this cursed sinne anoyeth grevousliche hem that it haunten. and first to hir soule; for he oblygeth it to sinne and to peyne of deeth that is perdurable.  unto the body anoyeth it grevously also for it dreyeth him and wasteth and shent him and of his blood he maketh sacrifyce to the feend of helle; it wasteth his catel and his substaunce.  and certes if it be a foul thing a man to waste his catel on wommen yet is it a fouler thing whan that for swich ordure wommen dispenden upon men hir catel and substaunce.  this sinne as seith the prophete bireveth man and womman hir gode fame and al hir honour; and it is ful pleasaunt to the devel; for therby winneth he the moste partie of this world.  and right as a marchant delyteth him most in chaffare that he hath most avantage of right so delyteth the feend in this ordure.  this is that other hand of the devel with fyve fingres to cacche the peple to his vileinye.  the firste finger is the fool lookinge of the fool womman and of the fool man that sleeth right as the basilicok sleeth folk by the venim of his sighte; for the coveitise of eyen folweth the coveitise of the herte.  the seconde finger is the vileyns touchinge in wikkede manere; and therfore seith salomon that whoso toucheth and handleth a womman he fareth lyk him that handleth the scorpioun that stingeth and sodeynly sleeth thurgh his enveniminge; as whoso toucheth warm pich it shent hise fingres.  the thridde is foule wordes that fareth lyk fyr that right anon brenneth the herte.  the fourthe finger is the kissinge; and trewely he were a greet fool that wolde kisse the mouth of a brenninge ovene or of a fourneys.  and more fooles been they that kissen in vileinye; for that mouth is the mouth of helle: and namely thise olde dotardes holours yet wol they kisse though they may nat do and smatre hem.  certes they been lyk to houndes; for an hound whan he comth by the roser or by othere busshes though he may nat pisse yet wole he heve up his leg and make a contenaunce to pisse.  and for that many man weneth that he may nat sinne for no likerousnesse that he doth with his wyf; certes that opinion is fals. god woot a man may sleen himself with his owene knyf and make himselven dronken of his owene tonne.  certes be it wyf be it child or any worldly thing that he loveth biforn god it is his maumet and he is an ydolastre.  man sholde loven his wyf by discrecioun paciently and atemprely; and thanne is she as though it were his suster.  the fifthe finger of the develes hand is the stinkinge dede of lecherie.  certes the fyve fingres of glotonie the feend put in the wombe of a man and with hise fyve fyngres of lecherie he gripeth him by the reynes for to throwen him into the fourneys of helle;  theras they shul han the fyr and the wormes that evere shul lasten and wepinge and wailinge sharp hunger and thurst and grimnesse of develes that shullen al totrede hem withouten respit and withouten ende.  of lecherie as i seyde sourden diverse speces; as fornicacioun that is bitwixe man and womman that been nat maried; and this is deedly sinne and agayns nature.  al that is enemy and destruccioun to nature is agayns nature.  parfay the resoun of a man telleth eek him wel that it is deedly sinne forasmuche as god forbad lecherie. and seint paul yeveth hem the regne that nis dewe to no wight but to hem that doon deedly sinne.  another sinne of lecherie is to bireve a mayden of hir maydenhede; for he that so dooth certes he casteth a mayden out of the hyeste degree that is in this present lyf  and bireveth hir thilke precious fruit that the book clepeth the hundred fruit. i ne can seye it noon other weyes in english but in latin it highte centesimus fructus.  certes he that so dooth is cause of manye damages and vileinyes mo than any man can rekene; right as he somtyme is cause of alle damages that bestes don in the feeld that breketh the hegge or the closure; thurgh which he destroyeth that may nat been restored.  for certes namore may maydenhede be restored than an arm that is smiten fro the body may retourne agayn to wexe.  she may have mercy this woot i wel if she do penitence; but nevere shal it be that she nas corrupt.  and albeit so that i have spoken somwhat of avoutrie it is good to shewen mo perils that longen to avoutrie for to eschue that foule sinne.  avoutrie in latin is for to seyn approchinge of other mannes bed thurgh which tho that whylom weren o flessh abaundone hir bodyes to othere persones.  of this sinne as seith the wyse man folwen manye harmes. first brekinge of feith; and certes in feith is the keye of cristendom.  and whan that feith is broken and lorn soothly cristendom stant veyn and withouten fruit.  this sinne is eek a thefte; for thefte generally is for to reve a wight his thing agayns his wille.  certes this is the fouleste thefte that may be whan a womman steleth hir body from hir housbonde and yeveth it to hire holour to defoulen hir; and steleth hir soule fro crist and yeveth it to the devel.  this is a fouler thefte than for to breke a chirche and stele the chalice; for thise avoutiers breken the temple of god spiritually and stelen the vessel of grace that is the body and the soule for which crist shal destroyen hem as seith seint paul.  soothly of this thefte douted gretly joseph whan that his lordes wyf preyed him of vileinye whan he seyde lo my lady how my lord hath take to me under my warde al that he hath in this world; ne nothing of hise thinges is out of my power but only ye that been his wyf.  and how sholde i thanne do this wikkednesse and sinne so horribly agayns god and agayns my lord? god it forbede. allas! al to litel is swich trouthe now yfounde!  the thridde harm is the filthe thurgh which they breken the comandement of god and defoulen the auctour of matrimoine that is crist.  for certes insomuche as the sacrement of mariage is so noble and so digne so muche is it gretter sinne for to breken it; for god made mariage in paradys in the estaat of innocence to multiplye mankinde to the service of god.  and therfore is the brekinge therof more grevous. of which brekinge comen false heires ofte tyme that wrongfully occupyen folkes heritages. and therfore wol crist putte hem out of the regne of hevene that is heritage to gode folk.  of this brekinge comth eek ofte tyme that folk unwar wedden or sinnen with hir owene kinrede; and namely thilke harlottes that haunten bordels of thise fool wommen that mowe be lykned to a commune gonge whereas men purgen hir ordure.  what seye we eek of putours that liven by the horrible sinne of putrie and constreyne wommen to yelden to hem a certeyn rente of hir bodily puterie ye somtyme of his owene wyf or his child; as doon this baudes? certes thise been cursede sinnes.  understond eek that avoutrie is set gladly in the ten comandements bitwixe thefte and manslaughtre; for it is the gretteste thefte that may be; for it is thefte of body and of soule.  and it is lyk to homicyde; for it kerveth atwo and breketh atwo hem that first were maked o flesh and therfore by the olde lawe of god they sholde be slayn.  but nathelees by the lawe of iesu crist that is lawe of pitee whan he seyde to the womman that was founden in avoutrie and sholde han been slayn with stones after the wil of the iewes as was hir lawe: go quod iesu crist and have namore wil to sinne; or wille namore to do sinne.  soothly the vengeaunce of avoutrie is awarded to the peynes of helle butif so be that it be destourbed by penitence.  yet been ther mo speces of this cursed sinne; as whan that oon of hem is religious or elles bothe; or of folk that been entred into ordre as subdekne or dekne or preest or hospitaliers. and evere the hyer that he is in ordre the gretter is the sinne.  the thinges that gretly agreggen hir sinne is the brekinge of hir avow of chastitee whan they receyved the ordre.  and fortherover sooth is that holy ordre is chief of al the tresorie of god and his especial signe and mark of chastitee; to shewe that they been ioyned to chastitee which that is most precious lyf that is.  and thise ordred folk been specially tytled to god and of the special meynee of god; for which whan they doon deedly sinne they been the special traytours of god and of his peple; for they liven of the peple to preye for the peple and whyle they been suche traitours hir preyers availen nat to the peple.  preestes been aungeles as by the dignitee of hir misterye; but for sothe seint paul seith that sathanas transformeth him in an aungel of light.  soothly the preest that haunteth deedly sinne he may be lykned to the aungel of derknesse transformed in the aungel of light; he semeth aungel of light but for sothe he is aungel of derknesse.  swiche preestes been the sones of helie as sheweth in the book of kinges that they weren the sones of belial that is the devel.  belial is to seyn withouten iuge; and so faren they; hem thinketh they been free and han no iuge namore than hath a free bole that taketh which cow that him lyketh in the toun.  so faren they by wommen. for right as a free bole is ynough for al a toun right so is a wikked preest corrupcioun ynough for al a parisshe or for al a contree.  thise preestes as seith the book ne conne nat the misterie of preesthode to the peple ne god ne knowe they nat; they ne helde hem nat apayd as seith the book of soden flesh that was to hem offred but they toke by force the flesh that is rawe.  certes so thise shrewes ne holden hem nat apayed of rosted flesh and sode flesh with which the peple fedden hem in greet reverence but they wole have raw flesh of folkes wyves and hir doghtres.  and certes thise wommen that consenten to hir harlotrie doon greet wrong to crist and to holy chirche and alle halwes and to alle soules; for they bireven alle thise him that sholde worshipe crist and holy chirche and preye for cristene soules.  and therfore han swiche preestes and hir lemmanes eek that consenten to hir lecherie the malisoun of al the court cristen till they come to amendement.  the thridde spece of avoutrie is somtyme bitwixe a man and his wyf; and that is whan they take no reward in hir assemblinge but only to hire fleshly delyt as seith seint ierome;  and ne rekken of nothing but that they been assembled; bycause that they been maried al is good ynough as thinketh to hem.  but in swich folk hath the devel power as seyde the aungel raphael to thobie; for in hir assemblinge they putten iesu crist out of hir herte and yeven hemself to alle ordure.  the fourthe spece is the assemblee of hem that been of hire kinrede or of hem that been of oon affinitee or elles with hem with whiche hir fadres or hir kinrede han deled in the sinne of lecherie; this sinne maketh hem lyk to houndes that taken no kepe to kinrede.  and certes parentele is in two maneres outher goostly or fleshly; goostly as for to delen with hise godsibbes.  for right so as he that engendreth a child is his fleshly fader right so is his godfader his fader espirituel. for which a womman may in no lasse sinne assemblen with hir godsib than with hir owene fleshly brother.  the fifthe spece is thilke abhominable sinne of which that no man unnethe oghte speke ne wryte nathelees it is openly reherced in holy writ.  this cursednesse doon men and wommen in diverse entente and in diverse manere; but though that holy writ speke of horrible sinne certes holy writ may nat been defouled namore than the sonne that shyneth on the mixen.  another sinne aperteneth to lecherie that comth in slepinge; and this sinne cometh ofte to hem that been maydenes and eek to hem that been corrupt; and this sinne men clepen pollucioun that comth in foure maneres.  somtyme of languissinge of body; for the humours been to ranke and habundaunt in the body of man. somtyme of infermetee; for the feblesse of the vertu retentif as phisik maketh mencioun. somtyme for surfeet of mete and drinke.  and somtyme of vileyns thoghtes that been enclosed in mannes minde whan he goth to slepe; which may nat been withoute sinne. for which men moste kepen hem wysely or elles may men sinnen ful grevously.  remedium contra peccatum luxurie. now comth the remedie agayns lecherie and that is generally chastitee and continence that restreyneth alle the desordeynee moevinges that comen of fleshly talentes.  and evere the gretter merite shal he han that most restreyneth the wikkede eschaufinges of the ordure of this sinne. and this is in two maneres that is to seyn chastitee in mariage and chastitee of widwehode.  now shaltow understonde that matrimoine is leefful assemblinge of man and of womman that receyven by vertu of the sacrement the bond thurgh which they may nat be departed in al hir lyf that is to seyn whyl that they liven bothe.  this as seith the book is a ful greet sacrement. god maked it as i have seyd in paradys and wolde himself be born in mariage.  and for to halwen mariage he was at a weddinge whereas he turned water into wyn; which was the firste miracle that he wroghte in erthe biforn hise disciples.  trewe effect of mariage clenseth fornicacioun and replenisseth holy chirche of good linage; for that is the ende of mariage; and it chaungeth deedly sinne into venial sinne bitwise hem that been ywedded and maketh the hertes al oon of hem that been ywedded as wel as the bodies.  this is verray mariage that was establissed by god er that sinne bigan whan naturel lawe was in his right point in paradys; and it was ordeyned that o man sholde have but o womman and o womman but o man as seith seint augustin by manye resouns.  first for mariage is figured bitwixe crist and holy chirche. and that other is for a man is heved of a womman; algate by ordinaunce it sholde be so.  for if a womman had mo men than oon thanne sholde she have mo hevedes than oon and that were an horrible thing biforn god; and eek a womman ne mighte nat plese to many folk at ones. and also ther ne sholde nevere be pees ne reste amonges hem; for everich wolde axen his owene thing.  and fortherover no man ne sholde knowe his owene engendrure ne who sholde have his heritage; and the womman sholde been the lasse biloved fro the time that she were conioynt to many men.  now comth how that a man sholde bere him with his wyf; and namely in two thinges that is to seyn in suffraunce and reverence as shewed crist whan he made first womman.  for he ne made hir nat of the heved of adam for she sholde nat clayme to greet lordshipe.  for theras the womman hath the maistrie she maketh to muche desray; ther neden none ensamples of this. the experience of day by day oghte suffyse.  also certes god ne made nat womman of the foot of adam for she ne sholde nat been holden to lowe; for she can nat paciently suffre: but god made womman of the rib of adam for womman sholde be felawe unto man.  man sholde bere him to his wyf in feith in trouthe and in love as seith seint paul: that a man sholde loven his wyf as crist loved holy chirche that loved it so wel that he deyde for it. so sholde a man for his wyf if it were nede.  now how that a womman sholde be subget to hir housbonde that telleth seint peter. first in obedience.  and eek as seith the decree a womman that is a wyf as longe as she is a wyf she hath noon auctoritee to swere ne bere witnesse withoute leve of hir housbonde that is hir lord; algate he sholde be so by resoun.  she sholde eek serven him in alle honestee and been attempree of hir array. i wot wel that they sholde setten hir entente to plesen hir housbondes but nat by hir queyntise of array.  seint ierome seith that wyves that been apparailled in silk and in precious purpre ne mowe nat clothen hem in iesu crist. what seith seint iohn eek in this matere?  seint gregorie eek seith that no wight seketh precious array but only for veyne glorie to been honoured the more biforn the peple.  it is a greet folye a womman to have a fair array outward and in hirself be foul inward.  a wyf sholde eek be mesurable in lokinge and in beringe and in laughinge and discreet in alle hir wordes and hir dedes.  and aboven alle worldly thing she sholde loven hir housbonde with al hir herte and to him be trewe of hir body  so sholde an housbonde eek be to his wyf. for sith that al the body is the housbondes so sholde hir herte been or elles ther is bitwixe hem two as in that no parfit mariage.  thanne shal men understonde that for three thinges a man and his wyf fleshly mowen assemble. the firste is in entente of engendrure of children to the service of god for certes that is the cause fynal of matrimoine.  another cause is to yelden everich of hem to other the dette of hir bodies for neither of hem hath power over his owene body. the thridde is for to eschewe lecherye and vileinye. the ferthe is for sothe deadly sinne.  as to the firste it is meritorie; the seconde also; for as seith the decree that she hath merite of chastitee that yeldeth to hir housbonde the dette of hir body ye though it be agayn hir lykinge and the lust of hir herte.  the thridde manere is venial sinne and trewely scarsly may ther any of thise be withoute venial sinne for the corrupcion and for the delyt.  the fourthe manere is for to understonde if they assemble only for amorous love and for noon of the forseyde causes but for to accomplice thilke brenninge delyt they rekke nevere how ofte sothly it is deedly sinne; and yet with sorwe somme folk wol peynen hem more to doon than to hir appetyt suffyseth.  the seconde manere of chastitee is for to been a clene widewe and eschue the embracinges of man and desyren the embracinge of iesu crist.  thise been tho that han been wyves and han forgoon hir housbondes and eek wommen that han doon lecherie and been releeved by penitence.  and certes if that a wyf coude kepen hir al chaast by licence of hir housbonde so that she yeve nevere noon occasion that he agilte it were to hire a greet merite.  thise manere wommen that observen chastitee moste be clene in herte as well as in body and in thoght and mesurable in clothinge and in contenaunce; and been abstinent in etinge and drinkinge in spekinge and in dede. they been the vessel or the boyste of the blissed magdelene that fulfilleth holy chirche of good odour.  the thridde manere of chastitee is virginitee and it bihoveth that she be holy in herte and clene of body; thanne is she spouse to iesu crist and she is the lyf of angeles.  she is the preisinge of this world and she is as thise martirs in egalitee; she hath in hir that tonge may nat telle ne herte thinke.  virginitee baar oure lord iesu crist and virgin was himselve.  another remedie agayns lecherie is specially to withdrawen swiche thinges as yeve occasion to thilke vileinye; as ese etinge and drinkinge; for certes whan the pot boyleth strongly the beste remedie is to withdrawe the fyr. slepinge longe in greet quiete is eek a greet norice to lecherie.  another remedie agayns lecherie is that a man or a womman eschue the companye of hem by whiche he douteth to be tempted; for albeit so that the dede is withstonden yet is ther greet temptacioun.  soothly a whyt wal although it ne brenne noght fully by stikinge of a candele yet is the wal blak of the leyt.  ful ofte tyme i rede that no man truste in his owene perfeccioun but he be stronger than sampson and holier than david and wyser than salomon.  now after that i have declared yow as i can the sevene deedly sinnes and somme of hir braunches and hir remedies soothly if i coude i wolde telle yow the ten comandements.  but so heigh a doctrine i lete to divines. nathelees i hope to god they been touched in this tretice everich of hem alle.  de confessione. now forasmuche as the second partie of penitence stant in confessioun of mouth as i bigan in the firste chapitre i seye seint augustin seith:  sinne is every word and every dede and al that men coveiten agayn the lawe of iesu crist; and this is for to sinne in herte in mouth and in dede by thy fyve wittes that been sighte heringe smellinge tastinge or savouringe and felinge.  now is it good to understonde that that agreggeth muchel every sinne.  thou shall considere what thou art that doost the sinne whether thou be male or femele yong or old gentil or thral free or servant hool or syk wedded or sengle ordred or unordred wys or fool clerk or seculer;  if she be of thy kinrede bodily or goostly or noon; if any of thy kinrede have sinned with hir or noon and manye mo thinges.  another circumstaunce is this; whether it be doon in fornicacioun or in avoutrie or noon; incest or noon; mayden or noon; in manere of homicyde or noon; horrible grete sinnes or smale; and how longe thou hast continued in sinne.  the thridde circumstaunce is the place ther thou hast do sinne; whether in other mennes hous or in thyn owene; in feeld or in chirche or in chirchehawe; in chirche dedicat or noon.  for if the chirche be halwed and man or womman spille his kinde inwith that place by wey of sinne or by wikked temptacion the chirche is entredited til it be reconciled by the bishop;  and the preest that dide swich a vileinye to terme of al his lyf he sholde namore singe masse; and if he dide he sholde doon deedly sinne at every tyme that he so songe masse.  the fourthe circumstaunce is by whiche mediatours or by whiche messagers as for entycement or for consentement to bere companye with felaweshipe; for many a wrecche for to bere companye wil go to the devel of helle.  wherfore they that eggen or consenten to the sinne been parteners of the sinne and of the dampnacioun of the sinner.  the fifthe circumstaunce is how manye tymes that he hath sinned if it be in his minde and how ofte that he hath falle.  for he that ofte falleth in sinne he despiseth the mercy of god and encreesseth his sinne and is unkinde to crist; and he wexeth the more feble to withstonde sinne and sinneth the more lightly  and the latter aryseth and is the more eschew for to shryven him namely to him that is his confessour.  for which that folk whan they falle agayn in hir olde folies outher they forleten hir olde confessours al outrely or elles they departen hir shrift in diverse places; but soothly swich departed shrift deserveth no mercy of god of hise sinnes.  the sixte circumstaunce is why that a man sinneth as by whiche temptacioun; and if himself procure thilke temptacioun or by the excytinge of other folk; or if he sinne with a womman by force or by hir owene assent;  or if the womman maugree hir heed hath been afforced or noon; this shal she telle; for coveitise or for poverte and if it was hir procuringe or noon; and swiche manere harneys.  the seventhe circumstaunce is in what manere he hath doon his sinne or how that she hath suffred that folk han doon to hir.  and the same shal the man telle pleynly with alle circumstaunces; and whether he hath sinned with comune bordelwommen or noon;  or doon his sinne in holy tymes or noon; in fastingtymes or noon; or biforn his shrifte or after his latter shrifte;  and hath peraventure broken therfore his penance enioyned; by whos help and whos conseil; by sorcerie or craft; al moste be told.  alle thise thinges after that they been grete or smale engreggen the conscience of man. and eek the preest that is thy iuge may the bettre been avysed of his iugement in yevinge of thy penaunce and that is after thy contricioun.  for understond wel that after tyme that a man hath defouled his baptesme by sinne if he wole come to salvacioun ther is noon other wey but by penitence and shrifte and satisfaccioun;  and namely by the two if ther be a confessour to which he may shryven him; and the thridde if he have lyf to parfournen it.  thanne shal man looke and considere that if he wole maken a trewe and a profitable confessioun ther moste be foure condiciouns.  first it moot been in sorweful bitternesse of herte as seyde the king ezekias to god: i wol remembre me alle the yeres of my lyf in bitternesse of myn herte.  this condicioun of bitternesse hath fyve signes. the firste is that confessioun moste be shamefast nat for to covere ne hyden his sinne for he hath agilt his god and defouled his soule.  and herof seith seint augustin: the herte travailleth for shame of his sinne; and for he hath greet shamefastnesse he is digne to have greet mercy of god.  swich was the confession of the publican that wolde nat heven up hise eyen to hevene for he hadde offended god of hevene; for which shamefastnesse he hadde anon the mercy of god.  and therof seith seint augustin that swich shamefast folk been next foryevenesse and remissioun.  another signe is humilitee in confessioun; of which seith seint peter humbleth yow under the might of god. the hond of god is mighty in confession for therby god foryeveth thee thy sinnes; for he allone hath the power.  and this humilitee shal been in herte and in signe outward; for right as he hath humilitee to god in his herte right so sholde he humble his body outward to the preest that sit in goddes place.  for which in no manere sith that crist is sovereyn and the preest mene and mediatour bitwixe crist and the sinnere and the sinnere is the laste by wey of resoun  thanne sholde nat the sinnere sitte as heighe as his confessour but knele biforn him or at his feet butif maladie destourbe it. for he shal nat taken kepe who sit there but in whos place that he sitteth.  a man that hath trespased to a lord and comth for to axe mercy and maken his accord and set him doun anon by the lord men wolde holden him outrageous and nat worthy so sone for to have remissioun ne mercy.  the thridde signe is how that thy shrift sholde be ful of teres if man may; and if man may nat wepe with hise bodily eyen lat him wepe in herte.  swich was the confession of seint peter; for after that he hadde forsake iesu crist he wente out and weep ful bitterly.  the fourthe signe is that he ne lette nat for shame to shewen his confessioun.  swich was the confessioun of the magdelene that ne spared for no shame of hem that weren atte feste for to go to oure lord iesu crist and biknowe to him hir sinnes.  the fifthe signe is that a man or a womman be obeisant to receyven the penaunce that him is enioyned for hise sinnes; for certes iesu crist for the giltes of a man was obedient to the deeth.  the seconde condicion of verray confession is that it be hastily doon; for certes if a man hadde a deedly wounde evere the lenger that he taried to warisshe himself the more wolde it corrupte and haste him to his deeth; and eek the wounde wolde be the wors for to hele.  and right so fareth sinne that longe tyme is in a man unshewed.  certes a man oghte hastily shewen hise sinnes for manye causes; as for drede of deeth that cometh ofte sodenly and is in no certeyn what tyme it shal be ne in what place; and eek the drecchinge of o synne draweth in another;  and eek the lenger that he tarieth the ferther he is fro crist. and if he abyde to his laste day scarsly may he shryven him or remembre him of hise sinnes or repenten him for the grevous maladie of his deeth.  and forasmuche as he ne hath nat in his lyf herkned iesu crist whanne he hath spoken he shal crye to iesu crist at his laste day and scarsly wol he herkne him.  and understond that this condicioun moste han foure thinges. thy shrift moste be purveyed bifore and avysed; for wikked haste doth no profit; and that a man conne shryve him of hise sinnes be it of pryde or of envye and so forth of the speces and circumstances;  and that he have comprehended in his minde the nombre and the greetnesse of hise sinnes and how longe that he hath leyn in sinne;  and eek that he be contrit of hise sinnes and in stedefast purpos by the grace of god nevere eft to falle in sinne; and eek that he drede and countrewaite himself that he flee the occasiouns of sinne to whiche he is enclyned.  also thou shalt shryve thee of alle thy sinnes to o man and nat a parcel to o man and a parcel to another; that is to understonde in entente to departe thy confessioun as for shame or drede; for it nis but stranglinge of thy soule.  for certes iesu crist is entierly al good; in him nis noon inperfeccioun; and therfore outher he foryeveth al parfitly or never a deel.  i seye nat that if thou be assigned to the penitauncer for certein sinne that thou art bounde to shewen him al the remenaunt of thy sinnes of whiche thou hast be shriven to thy curat butif it lyke to thee of thyn humilitee; this is no departinge of shrifte.  ne i seye nat theras i speke of divisioun of confessioun that if thou have lycence for to shryve thee to a discreet and an honeste preest where thee lyketh and by lycence of thy curat that thou ne mayst wel shryve thee to him of alle thy sinnes.  but lat no blotte be bihinde; lat no sinne been untold as fer as thou hast remembraunce.  and whan thou shalt be shriven to thy curat telle him eek alle the sinnes that thou hast doon sin thou were last yshriven; this is no wikked entente of divisioun of shrifte.  also the verray shrifte axeth certeine condiciouns. first that thou shryve thee by thy free wil noght constreyned ne for shame of folk ne for maladie ne swiche thinges; for it is resoun that he that trespasseth by his free wil that by his free wil he confesse his trespas;  and that noon other man telle his sinne but he himself ne he shal nat nayte ne denye his sinne ne wratthe him agayn the preest for his amonestinge to leve sinne.  the seconde condicioun is that thy shrift be laweful; that is to seyn that thou that shryvest thee and eek the preest that hereth thy confessioun been verraily in the feith of holy chirche;  and that a man ne be nat despeired of the mercy of iesu crist as caym or iudas.  and eek a man moot accusen himself of his owene trespas and nat another; but he shal blame and wyten himself and his owene malice of his sinne and noon other;  but nathelees if that another man be occasioun or entycer of his sinne or the estaat of a persone be swich thurgh which his sinne is agregged or elles that he may nat pleynly shryven him but he telle the persone with which he hath sinned; thanne may he telle;  so that his entente ne be nat to bakbyte the persone but only to declaren his confessioun.  thou ne shall nat eek make no lesinges in thy confessioun; for humilitee peraventure to seyn that thou hast doon sinnes of whiche that thou were nevere gilty.  for seint augustin seith: if thou by cause of thyn humilitee makest lesinges on thyself though thou ne were nat in sinne biforn yet artow thanne in sinne thurgh thy lesinges.  thou most eek shewe thy sinne by thyn owene propre mouth but thou be wexe doumb and nat by no lettre; for thou that hast doon the sinne thou shalt have the shame therfore.  thou shalt nat eek peynte thy confessioun by faire subtile wordes to covere the more thy sinne; for thanne bigylestow thyself and nat the preest; thou most tellen it pleynly be it nevere so foul ne so horrible.  thou shalt eek shryve thee to a preest that is discreet to conseille thee and eek thou shalt nat shryve thee for veyne glorie ne for ypocrisye ne for no cause but only for the doute of iesu crist and the hele of thy soule.  thou shalt nat eek renne to the preest sodeynly to tellen him lightly thy sinne as whoso telleth a iape or a tale but avysely and with greet devocioun.  and generally shryve thee ofte. if thou ofte falle ofte thou aryse by confessioun.  and thogh thou shryve thee ofter than ones of sinne of which thou hast be shriven it is the more merite. and as seith seint augustin thou shalt have the more lightly relesing and grace of god bothe of sinne and of peyne.  and certes ones a yere atte leeste wey it is laweful for to been housled; for certes ones a yere alle thinges renovellen.  explicit secunda pars penitencie; et sequitur tercia pars eiusdem de satisfaccione. now have i told you of verray confessioun that is the seconde partie of penitence.  the thridde partie of penitence is satisfaccioun; and that stant most generally in almesse and in bodily peyne.  now been ther three manere of almesses; contricion of herte where a man offreth himself to god; another is to han pitee of defaute of hise neighebores; and the thridde is in yevinge of good conseil goostly and bodily where men han nede and namely in sustenaunce of mannes fode.  and tak keep that a man hath need of thise thinges generally; he hath need of fode he hath nede of clothing and herberwe he hath nede of charitable conseil and visitinge in prisone and in maladie and sepulture of his dede body.  and if thou mayst nat visite the nedeful with thy persone visite him by thy message and by thy yiftes.  thise been generally almesses or werkes of charitee of hem that han temporel richesses or discrecioun in conseilinge. of thise werkes shaltow heren at the day of dome.  thise almesses shaltow doon of thyne owene propre thinges and hastily and prively if thou mayst;  but nathelees if thou mayst nat doon it prively thou shalt nat forbere to doon almesse though men seen it; so that it be nat doon for thank of the world but only for thank of iesu crist.  for as witnesseth seint mathew capitulo quinto a citee may nat been hid that is set on a montayne; ne men lighte nat a lanterne and put it under a busshel; but men sette it on a candlestikke to yeve light to the men in the hous.  right so shal youre light lighten bifore men that they may seen youre gode werkes and glorifie youre fader that is in hevene.  now as to speken of bodily peyne it stant in preyeres in wakinges in fastinges in vertuouse techinges of orisouns.  and ye shul understonde that orisouns or preyeres is for to seyn a pilous wil of herte that redresseth it in god and expresseth it by word outward to remoeven harmes and to han thinges espirituel and durable and somtyme temporel thinges; of whiche orisouns certes in the orisoun of the paternoster hath iesu crist enclosed most thinges.  certes it is privileged of three thinges in his dignitee for which it is more digne than any other preyere; for that iesu crist himself maked it;  and it is short for it sholde be coud the more lightly and for to withholden it the more esily in herte and helpen himself the ofter with the orisoun;  and for a man sholde be the lasse wery to seyen it and for a man may nat excusen him to lerne it it is so short and so esy; and for it comprehendeth in itself alle gode preyeres.  the exposicioun of this holy preyere that is so excellent and digne i bitake to thise maistres of theologie; save thus muchel wol i seyn: that whan thou prayest that god sholde foryeve thee thy giltes as thou foryevest hem that agilten to thee be ful wel war that thou be nat out of charitee.  this holy orisoun amenuseth eek venial sinne; and therfore it aperteneth specially to penitence.  this preyere moste be trewely seyd and in verray feith and that men preye to god ordinatly and discreetly and devoutly; and alwey a man shal putten his wil to be subget to the wille of god.  this orisoun moste eek been seyd with greet humblesse and ful pure; honestly and nat to the anoyaunce of any man or womman. it moste eek been continued with the werkes of charitee.  it avayleth eek agayn the vyces of the soule; for as seith seint ierome by fastinge been saved the vyces of the flesh and by preyere the vyces of the soule.  after this thou shalt understonde that bodily peyne stant in wakinge; for iesu crist seith waketh and preyeth that ye ne entre in wikked temptacioun.  ye shul understanden also that fastinge stant in three thinges; in forberinge of bodily mete and drinke and in forberinge of worldly iolitee and in forberinge of deedly sinne; this is to seyn that a man shal kepen him fro deedly sinne with al his might.  and thou shalt understanden eek that god ordeyned fastinge; and to fastinge appertenen foure thinges.  largenesse to povre folk gladnesse of herte espirituel nat to been angry ne anoyed ne grucche for he fasteth; and also resonable houre for to ete by mesure; that is for to seyn a man shal nat ete in untyme ne sitte the lenger at his table to ete for he fasteth.  thanne shaltow understonde that bodily peyne stant in disciplyne or techinge by word or by wrytinge or in ensample. also in weringe of heyres or of stamin or of haubergeons on hir naked flesh for cristes sake and swiche manere penances.  but war thee wel that swiche manere penances on thy flesh ne make nat thyn herte bitter or angry or anoyed of thyself; for bettre is to caste awey thyn heyre than for to caste away the sikernesse of iesu crist.  and therfore seith seint paul: clothe yow as they that been chosen of god in herte of misericorde debonairetee suffraunce and swich manere of clothinge; of whiche iesu crist is more apayed than of heyres or haubergeons or hauberkes.  thanne is disciplyne eek in knokkinge of thy brest in scourginge with yerdes in knelinges in tribulacions;  in suffringe paciently wronges that been doon to thee and eek in pacient suffraunce of maladies or lesinge of worldly catel or of wyf or of child or othere freendes.  thanne shaltow understonde whiche thinges destourben penaunce; and this is in foure maneres that is drede shame hope and wanhope that is desperacion.  and for to speke first of drede; for which he weneth that he may suffre no penaunce;  theragayns is remedie for to thinke that bodily penaunce is but short and litel at regard of the peyne of helle that is so cruel and so long that it lasteth withouten ende.  now again the shame that a man hath to shryven him and namely thise ypocrites that wolden been holden so parfite that they han no nede to shryven hem;  agayns that shame sholde a man thinke that by wey of resoun that he that hath nat been ashamed to doon foule thinges certes him oghte nat been ashamed to do faire thinges and that is confessiouns.  a man sholde eek thinke that god seeth and wool alle hise thoghtes and alle hise werkes; to him may no thing been hid ne covered.  men sholden eek remembren hem of the shame that is to come at the day of dome to hem that been nat penitent and shriven in this present lyf.  for alle the creatures in erthe and in helle shullen seen apertly al that they hyden in this world.  now for to speken of the hope of hem that been necligent and slowe to shryven hem that stant in two maneres.  that oon is that he hopeth for to live longe and for to purchacen muche richesse for his delyt and thanne he wol shryven him; and as he seith him semeth thanne tymely ynough to come to shrifte. another is surquidrie that he hath in cristes mercy.  agayns the firste vyce he shal thinke that oure lyf is in no sikernesse; and eek that alle the richesses in this world ben in aventure and passen as a shadwe on the wal.  and as seith seint gregorie that it aperteneth to the grete rightwisnesse of god that nevere shal the peyne stinte of hem that nevere wolde withdrawen hem fro sinne hir thankes but ay continue in sinne; for thilke perpetuel wil to do sinne shul they han perpetuel peyne.  wanhope is in two maneres: the firste wanhope is in the mercy of crist; that other is that they thinken that they ne mighte nat longe persevere in goodnesse.  the firste wanhope comth of that he demeth that he hath sinned so greetly and so ofte and so longe leyn in sinne that he shal nat be saved.  certes agayns that cursed wanhope sholde he thinke that the passion of iesu crist is more strong for to unbinde than sinne is strong for to binde.  agayns the seconde wanhope he shal thinke that as ofte as he falleth he may aryse agayn by penitence. and thogh he never so longe have leyn in sinne the mercy of crist is alwey redy to receiven him to mercy.  agayns the wanhope that he demeth that he sholde nat longe persevere in goodnesse he shal thinke that the feblesse of the devel may nothing doon butif men wol suffren him;  and eek he shal han strengthe of the help of god and of al holy chirche and of the proteccioun of aungels if him list.  thanne shal men understonde what is the fruit of penaunce; and after the word of iesu crist it is the endelees blisse of hevene  ther ioye hath no contrarioustee of wo ne grevaunce ther alle harmes been passed of this present lyf; theras is the sikernesse fro the peyne of helle; theras is the blisful companye that reioysen hem everemo everich of otheres ioye;  theras the body of man that whylom was foul and derk is more cleer than the sonne; theras the body that whylom was syk freele and feble and mortal is inmortal and so strong and so hool that ther may nothing apeyren it;  theras ne is neither hunger thurst ne cold but every soule replenissed with the sighte of the parfit knowinge of god.  this blisful regne may men purchace by poverte espirituel and the glorie by lowenesse; the plentee of ioye by hunger and thurst and the reste by travaille; and the lyf by deeth and mortificacion of sinne.  here taketh the makere of this book his leve. now preye i to hem alle that herkne this litel tretis or rede that if ther be any thing in it that lyketh hem that therof they thanken oure lord iesu crist of whom procedeth al wit and al goodnesse.  and if ther be any thing that displese hem i preye hem also that they arrette it to the defaute of myn unconninge and nat to my wil that wolde ful fayn have seyd bettre if i hadde had conninge.  for oure boke seith al that is writen is writen for oure doctrine; and that is myn entente.  wherfore i biseke yow mekely for the mercy of god that ye preye for me that crist have mercy on me and foryeve me my giltes:  and namely of my translacions and endytinges of worldly vanitees the whiche i revoke in my retracciouns:  as is the book of troilus; the book also of fame; the book of the nynetene ladies; the book of the duchesse; the book of seint valentynes day of the parlement of briddes; the tales of caunterbury thilke that sounen into sinne;  the book of the leoun; and many another book if they were in my remembrance; and many a song and many a lecherous lay; that crist for his grete mercy foryeve me the sinne.  but of the translacion of boece de consolacione and othere bokes of legendes of seintes and omelies and moralitee and devocioun  that thanke i oure lord iesu crist and his blisful moder and alle the seintes of hevene;  bisekinge hem that they from hennesforth unto my lyves ende sende me grace to biwayle my giltes and to studie to the salvacioun of my soule:and graunte me grace of verray penitence confessioun and satisfaccioun to doon in this present lyf;  thurgh the benigne grace of him that is king of kinges and preest over alle preestes that boghte us with the precious blood of his herte;  so that i may been oon of hem at the day of dome that shulle be saved: qui cum patre c.
