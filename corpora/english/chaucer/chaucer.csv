1.20.11,the answere of this i lete to divynis

1.22.6,perpetuelly is dampned to prisoun
1.22.7,in cheynes and in fettres to ben deed
1.22.8,and arcite is exyled upon his heed

1.25.5,so muche sorwe had never creature
1.25.6,that is or shal whyl that the world may dure
1.25.7,his sleep his mete his drink is him biraft

1.25.14,then wolde he wepe he mighte nat be stent
1.25.15,so feble eek were his spirits and so lowe
1.25.16,and chaunged so that no man coude knowe
1.25.17,his speche nor his vois though men it herde
1.25.18,and in his gere for al the world he ferde
1.25.19,nat oonly lyk the loveres maladye
1.25.20,of hereos but rather lyk manye
1.25.21,engendred of humour malencolyk
1.25.22,biforen in his celle fantastyk
1.25.23,and shortly turned was al upsodoun
1.25.24,bothe habit and eek disposicioun
1.25.25,of him this woful lovere daun arcite
1.26.1,what sholde i alday of his wo endyte
1.26.2,whan he endured hadde a yeer or two
1.26.3,this cruel torment and this peyne and wo
1.26.4,at thebes in his contree as i seyde
1.26.5,upon a night in sleep as he him leyde
1.26.6,him thoughte how that the winged god mercurie
1.26.7,biforn him stood and bad him to be murye
1.26.8,his slepy yerde in hond he bar uprighte
1.26.9,an hat he werede upon his heres brighte
1.26.10,arrayed was this god as he took keep
1.26.11,as he was whan that argus took his sleep
1.26.12,and seyde him thus to athenes shaltou wende
1.26.13,ther is thee shapen of thy wo an ende
1.26.14,and with that word arcite wook and sterte
1.26.15,now trewely how sore that me smerte
1.26.16,quod he to athenes right now wol i fare
1.26.17,ne for the drede of deeth shal i nat spare
1.26.18,to see my lady that i love and serve
1.26.19,in hir presence i recche nat to sterve
1.27.1,and with that word he caughte a greet mirour
1.27.2,and saugh that chaunged was al his colour
1.27.3,and saugh his visage al in another kinde
1.27.4,and right anoon it ran him in his minde
1.27.5,that sith his face was so disfigured
1.27.6,of maladye the which he hadde endured
1.27.7,he mighte wel if that he bar him lowe
1.27.8,live in athenes evermore unknowe
1.27.9,and seen his lady wel ny day by day
1.27.10,and right anon he chaunged his array
1.27.11,and cladde him as a povre laborer
1.27.12,and al allone save oonly a squyer
1.27.13,that knew his privetee and al his cas
1.27.14,which was disgysed povrely as he was
1.27.15,to athenes is he goon the nexte way
1.27.16,and to the court he wente upon a day
1.27.17,and at the gate he profreth his servyse
1.27.18,to drugge and drawe what so men wol devyse
1.27.19,and shortly of this matere for to seyn
1.27.20,he fil in office with a chamberleyn
1.27.21,the which that dwelling was with emelye
1.27.22,for he was wys and coude soon aspye
1.27.23,of every servaunt which that serveth here
1.27.24,wel coude he hewen wode and water bere
1.27.25,for he was yong and mighty for the nones
1.27.26,and therto be was strong and big of bones
1.27.27,to doon that any wight can him devyse
1.27.28,a yeer or two he was in this servyse
1.27.29,page of the chambre of emelye the brighte
1.27.30,and philostrate he seide that he highte
1.27.31,but half so wel biloved a man as he
1.27.32,ne was ther never in court of his degree
1.27.33,he was so gentil of condicioun
1.27.34,that thurghout al the court was his renoun
1.27.35,they seyden that it were a charitee
1.27.36,that theseus wolde enhauncen his degree
1.27.37,and putten him in worshipful servyse
1.27.38,ther as he mighte his vertu excercyse
1.27.39,and thus withinne a whyle his name is spronge
1.27.40,bothe of his dedes and his goode tonge
1.27.41,that theseus hath taken him so neer
1.27.42,that of his chambre he made him a squyer
1.27.43,and yaf him gold to mayntene his degree
1.27.44,and eek men broghte him out of his contree
1.27.45,from yeer to yeer ful prively his rente
1.27.46,but honestly and slyly he it spente
1.27.47,that no man wondred how that he it hadde
1.27.48,and three yeer in this wyse his lyf he ladde
1.27.49,and bar him so in pees and eek in werre
1.27.50,ther nas no man that theseus hath derre
1.27.51,and in this blisse lete i now arcite
1.27.52,and speke i wol of palamon a lyte
1.28.1,in derknesse and horrible and strong prisoun
1.28.2,this seven yeer hath seten palamoun
1.28.3,forpyned what for wo and for distresse
1.28.4,who feleth double soor and hevinesse
1.28.5,but palamon that love destreyneth so
1.28.6,that wood out of his wit he gooth for wo
1.28.7,and eek therto he is a prisoner
1.28.8,perpetuelly noght oonly for a yeer
1.28.9,who coude ryme in english proprely
1.28.10,his martirdom for sothe it am nat i
1.28.11,therefore i passe as lightly as i may
1.29.1,it fel that in the seventhe yeer in may
1.29.2,the thridde night as olde bokes seyn
1.29.3,that al this storie tellen more pleyn
1.29.4,were it by aventure or destinee
1.29.5,as whan a thing is shapen it shal be
1.29.6,that sone after the midnight palamoun
1.29.7,by helping of a freend brak his prisoun
1.29.8,and fleeth the citee faste as he may go
1.29.9,for he had yive his gayler drinke so
1.29.10,of a clarree maad of a certeyn wyn
1.29.11,with nercotikes and opie of thebes fyn
1.29.12,that al that night thogh that men wolde him shake
1.29.13,the gayler sleep he mighte nat awake
1.29.14,and thus he fleeth as faste as ever he may
1.29.15,the night was short and faste by the day
1.29.16,that nedescost he moste himselven hyde
1.29.17,and til a grove faste ther besyde
1.29.18,with dredful foot than stalketh palamoun
1.29.19,for shortly this was his opinioun
1.29.20,that in that grove he wolde him hyde al day
1.29.21,and in the night than wolde he take his way
1.29.22,to thebesward his freendes for to preye
1.29.23,on theseus to helpe him to werreye
1.29.24,and shortly outher he wolde lese his lyf
1.29.25,or winnen emelye unto his wyf
1.29.26,this is theffect and his entente pleyn
1.30.1,now wol i torne unto arcite ageyn
1.30.2,that litel wiste how ny that was his care
1.30.3,til that fortune had broght him in the snare
1.31.1,the bisy larke messager of day
1.31.2,salueth in hir song the morwe gray
1.31.3,and fyry phebus ryseth up so brighte
1.31.4,that al the orient laugheth of the lighte
1.31.5,and with his stremes dryeth in the greves
1.31.6,the silver dropes hanging on the leves
1.31.7,and arcite that is in the court royal
1.31.8,with theseus his squyer principal
1.31.9,is risen and loketh on the myrie day
1.31.10,and for to doon his observaunce to may

1.31.14,out of the court were it a myle or tweye
1.31.15,and to the grove of which that i yow tolde
1.31.16,by aventure his wey he gan to holde
1.31.17,to maken him a gerland of the greves
1.31.18,were it of wodebinde or hawethornleves

1.31.23,and from his courser with a lusty herte
1.31.24,into the grove ful hastily he sterte
1.31.25,and in a path he rometh up and doun
1.31.26,theras by aventure this palamoun
1.31.27,was in a bush that no man mighte him see

1.102.11,and gladder oghte his freend ben of his deeth
1.102.12,whan with honour upyolden is his breeth
1.102.13,than whan his name apalled is for age
1.102.14,for al forgeten is his vasselage
1.102.15,than is it best as for a worthy fame
1.102.16,to dyen whan that he is best of name
1.102.17,the contrarie of al this is wilfulnesse
1.102.18,why grucchen we why have we hevinesse

10.70.6,chees in a bath to deye in this manere
10.70.7,rather than han another tormentyse
10.70.8,and thus hath nero slayn his maister dere
10.71.1,now fil it so that fortune list no lenger

14.47.37,and venus falleth ther mercurie is reysed
14.47.38,therfore no womman of no clerk is preysed
14.47.39,the clerk whan he is old and may noght do
14.47.40,of venus werkes worth his olde sho

19.33.26,and many a yeer his service to me feyned
19.33.27,til that myn herte to pitous and to nyce
19.33.28,al innocent of his crouned malice
19.33.29,forfered of his deeth as thoughte me

19.33.31,graunted him love on this condicioun
19.33.32,that evermore myn honour and renoun
19.33.33,were saved bothe privee and apert
19.33.34,this is to seyn that after his desert

19.33.63,as wel his wordes as his contenaunce
19.33.64,and i so lovede him for his obeisaunce
19.33.65,and for the trouthe i demed in his herte
19.33.66,that if so were that any thing him smerte
19.33.67,al were it never so lyte and i it wiste
19.33.68,me thoughte i felte deeth myn herte twiste
19.33.69,and shortly so ferforth this thing is went

19.34.2,that i supposed of him noght but good
19.34.3,but fynally thus atte laste it stood
19.34.4,that fortune wolde that he moste twinne
19.34.5,out of that place which that i was inne

19.34.9,i knowe what is the peyne of deth therby
19.34.10,swich harm i felte for he ne mighte bileve
19.34.11,so on a day of me he took his leve

20.33.3,er any foot he mighte on erthe goon
20.33.4,ne confort in this tyme hadde he noon
20.33.5,save of his brother which that was a clerk
20.33.6,he knew of al this wo and al this werk
20.33.7,for to non other creature certeyn
20.33.8,of this matere he dorste no word seyn
20.33.9,under his brest he bar it more secree
20.33.10,than ever dide pamphilus for galathee
20.33.11,his brest was hool withoute for to sene

20.33.13,and wel ye knowe that of a sursanure
20.33.14,in surgerye is perilous the cure
20.33.15,but men mighte touche the arwe or come therby
20.33.16,his brother weep and wayled prively

20.33.22,particuler sciences for to lerne
20.33.23,he him remembred that upon a day
20.33.24,at orliens in studie a book he say
20.33.25,of magik natural which his felawe
20.33.26,that was that tyme a bacheler of lawe
20.33.27,al were he ther to lerne another craft
20.33.28,had prively upon his desk ylaft
20.33.29,which book spak muchel of the operaciouns
20.33.30,touchinge the eighte and twenty mansiouns

22.32.4,we fayle of that which that we wolden have

22.32.6,and whan we been togidres everichoon
22.32.7,every man semeth a salomon

22.32.12,right so lo fareth it amonges us
22.32.13,he that semeth the wysest by iesus

22.32.16,that shul ye knowe er that i fro yow wende

22.33.11,whan he commune shal with any wight
22.33.12,that he wol make him doten anon right
22.33.13,but it a feend be as himselven is
22.33.14,ful many a man hath he bigyled er this
