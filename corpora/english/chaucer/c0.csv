1,0,
1,1,what sholde i al-day of his wo endyte?

1,8,his slepy yerde in hond he bar uprighte;

1,10,arrayed was this god as he took keep
1,11,as he was whan that argus took his sleep; 
1,12,and seyde him thus: 'to athenes shaltou wende;
1,13,ther is thee shapen of thy wo an ende.'
1,14,and with that word arcite wook and sterte.

1,1,"and with that word he caughte a greet mirour,"
1,2,"and saugh that chaunged was al his colour, "
1,3,and saugh his visage al in another kinde.

1,5,"that, sith his face was so disfigured"
1,6,"of maladye, the which he hadde endured,"
1,7,"he mighte wel, if that he bar him lowe, "
1,8,"live in athenes ever-more unknowe,"
1,9,and seen his lady wel ny day by day.
1,10,"and right anon he chaunged his array, "

1,13,"that knew his privetee and al his cas,"
1,14,"which was disgysed povrely, as he was,"
1,15,to athenes is he goon the nexte way.
1,16,"and to the court he wente up-on a day,"
1,17,"and at the gate he profreth his servyse, "
1,18,"to drugge and drawe, what so men wol devyse."
1,19,"and shortly of this matere for to seyn,"
1,20,"he fil in office with a chamberleyn, "
1,21,the which that dwelling was with emelye.

1,24,"wel coude he hewen wode, and water bere,"
1,25,"for he was yong and mighty for the nones,"
1,26,and ther-to be was strong and big of bones

1,31,but half so wel biloved a man as he
1,32,"ne was ther never in court, of his degree; "
1,33,"he was so gentil of condicioun,"
1,34,that thurghout al the court was his renoun.
1,35,"they seyden, that it were a charitee"
1,36,"that theseus wolde enhauncen his degree,"
1,37,"and putten him in worshipful servyse, "
1,38,ther as he mighte his vertu excercyse.
1,39,"and thus, with-inne a whyle, his name is spronge"
1,40,"bothe of his dedes, and his goode tonge, "
1,41,that theseus hath taken him so neer
1,42,"that of his chambre he made him a squyer, "

1,45,"from yeer to yeer, ful prively, his rente;"
1,46,"but honestly and slyly he it spente,"
1,47,that no man wondred how that he it hadde. 
1,48,"and three yeer in this wyse his lyf he ladde,"
1,49,"and bar him so in pees and eek in werre,"
1,50,ther nas no man that theseus hath derre. 
1,51,"and in this blisse lete i now arcite,"
1,52,and speke i wol of palamon a lyte. 
1,0,
1,1,in derknesse and horrible and strong prisoun
1,2,"this seven yeer hath seten palamoun,"
1,3,"forpyned, what for wo and for distresse;"
1,4,who feleth double soor and hevinesse
1,5,"but palamon? that love destreyneth so, "
1,6,that wood out of his wit he gooth for wo;
1,7,and eek therto he is a prisoner
1,8,"perpetuelly, noght oonly for a yeer. "
1,9,who coude ryme in english proprely
1,10,"his martirdom? for sothe, it am nat i; "
1,11,therefore i passe as lightly as i may.

1,7,"by helping of a freend, brak his prisoun, "
1,8,"and fleeth the citee, faste as he may go;"
1,9,for he had yive his gayler drinke so 
1,10,"of a clarree, maad of a certeyn wyn,"
1,11,"with nercotikes and opie of thebes fyn,"
1,12,"that al that night, thogh that men wolde him shake,"
1,13,"the gayler sleep, he mighte nat awake;"
1,14,and thus he fleeth as faste as ever he may. 
1,15,"the night was short, and faste by the day,"
1,16,"that nedes-cost he moste him-selven hyde,"
1,17,"and til a grove, faste ther besyde, "
1,18,with dredful foot than stalketh palamoun.
1,19,"for shortly, this was his opinioun, "
1,20,"that in that grove he wolde him hyde al day,"
1,21,and in the night than wolde he take his way
1,22,"to thebes-ward, his freendes for to preye"
1,23,on theseus to helpe him to werreye;
1,24,"and shortly, outher he wolde lese his lyf, "

1,0,
1,1,"now wol i torne un-to arcite ageyn, "

1,7,"and arcite, that is in the court royal"
1,8,"with theseus, his squyer principal, "

1,10,"and, for to doon his observaunce to may, "
1,11,"remembring on the poynt of his desyr,"
1,12,"he on a courser, sterting as the fyr,"
1,13,"is riden in-to the feeldes, him to pleye,"
1,14,"out of the court, were it a myle or tweye;"
1,15,"and to the grove, of which that i yow tolde, "

1,17,"to maken him a gerland of the greves,"

1,21,"wel-come be thou, faire fresshe may,"
1,22,i hope that i som grene gete may.'
1,23,"and from his courser, with a lusty herte,"
1,24,"in-to the grove ful hastily he sterte,"
1,25,"and in a path he rometh up and doun, "
1,26,"ther-as, by aventure, this palamoun"

1,4,than semed me ther was a parlement

1,6,among the whiche poynts y-spoken was
1,7,"to have with certeyn contrees alliaunce,"
1,8,and have fully of thebans obeisaunce.
1,9,for which this noble theseus anon 
1,10,"leet senden after gentil palamon,"
1,11,unwist of him what was the cause and why;
1,12,but in his blake clothes sorwefully

1,14,tho sente theseus for emelye. 
1,15,"whan they were set, and hust was al the place,"

1,18,"his eyen sette he ther as was his lest,"
1,19,"and with a sad visage he syked stille, "
1,20,and after that right thus he seyde his wille.
1,0,
1,1,"'the firste moevere of the cause above,"
1,2,"whan he first made the faire cheyne of love, "
1,3,"greet was theffect, and heigh was his entente;"
1,4,"wel wiste he why, and what ther-of he mente; "
1,5,for with that faire cheyne of love he bond
1,6,"the fyr, the eyr, the water, and the lond"
1,7,"in certeyn boundes, that they may nat flee;"
1,8,"that same prince and that moevere,' quod he,"
1,9,"'hath stablissed, in this wrecched world adoun, "
1,10,certeyne dayes and duracioun

1,17,"than may men by this ordre wel discerne,"
1,18,that thilke moevere stable is and eterne.
1,19,"wel may men knowe, but it be a fool, "
1,20,that every part deryveth from his hool.
1,21,for nature hath nat take his beginning
1,22,"of no partye ne cantel of a thing, "
1,23,"but of a thing that parfit is and stable,"
1,24,"descending so, til it be corrumpable. "
1,25,"and therfore, of his wyse purveyaunce,"
1,26,"he hath so wel biset his ordinaunce,"
1,27,that speces of thinges and progressiouns
1,28,"shullen enduren by successiouns,"
1,29,"and nat eterne be, with-oute lye: "

1,2,"from tyme that it first biginneth springe, "
1,3,"and hath so long a lyf, as we may see,"
1,4,yet at the laste wasted is the tree. 
1,0,
1,1,"'considereth eek, how that the harde stoon"
1,2,"under our feet, on which we trede and goon,"
1,3,"yit wasteth it, as it lyth by the weye."
1,4,the brode river somtyme wexeth dreye.
1,5,the grete tounes see we wane and wende. 
1,6,than may ye see that al this thing hath ende.
1,0,
1,1,"'of man and womman seen we wel also,"
1,2,"that nedeth, in oon of thise termes two, "

1,8,thanne may i seyn that al this thing moot deye.
1,9,what maketh this but iupiter the king? 
1,10,"the which is prince and cause of alle thing,"
1,11,"converting al un-to his propre welle,"
1,12,"from which it is deryved, sooth to telle. "
1,13,and here-agayns no creature on lyve

1,2,"to maken vertu of necessitee,"
1,3,"and take it wel, that we may nat eschue,"
1,4,and namely that to us alle is due.
1,5,"and who-so gruccheth ought, he dooth folye, "
1,6,and rebel is to him that al may gye.
1,7,and certeinly a man hath most honour
1,8,"to dyen in his excellence and flour, "
1,9,whan he is siker of his gode name;

1,13,than whan his name apalled is for age;
1,14,for al forgeten is his vasselage.
1,15,"than is it best, as for a worthy fame, "
1,16,to dyen whan that he is best of name.
1,17,the contrarie of al this is wilfulnesse.
1,18,"why grucchen we? why have we hevinesse, "
1,19,"that good arcite, of chivalrye flour"
1,20,"departed is, with duetee and honour, "

1,4,"and, er that we departen from this place, "
1,5,"i rede that we make, of sorwes two,"
1,6,"o parfyt ioye, lasting ever-mo;"
1,7,"and loketh now, wher most sorwe is her-inne,"

1,15,"and he hir serveth al-so gentilly,"
1,16,that never was ther no word hem bitwene 
1,17,"of ielousye, or any other tene."
1,18,thus endeth palamon and emelye;

1,9,"for trewely, the game is wel bigonne."
1,10,"now telleth ye, sir monk, if that ye conne, "

1,0,
1,1,
1,0,
1,1,
2,0,
2,1,here biginneth the millere his tale.
2,0,
2,1,whylom ther was dwellinge at oxenford
2,2,"a riche gnof, that gestes heeld to bord,"
2,3,and of his craft he was a carpenter.
2,4,"with him ther was dwellinge a povre scoler, "
2,5,"had lerned art, but al his fantasye"
2,6,"was turned for to lerne astrologye,"
2,7,and coude a certeyn of conclusiouns
2,8,"to demen by interrogaciouns,"
2,9,"if that men axed him in certein houres, "
2,10,"whan that men sholde have droghte or elles shoures, "
2,11,or if men axed him what sholde bifalle
2,12,"of every thing, i may nat rekene hem alle."
2,0,
2,1,this clerk was cleped hende nicholas;
2,2,of derne love he coude and of solas; 
2,3,"and ther-to be was sleigh and ful privee,"
2,4,and lyk a mayden meke for to see.
2,5,a chambre hadde he in that hostelrye
2,6,"allone, with-outen any companye,"
2,7,ful fetisly y-dight with herbes swote; 
2,8,and he him-self as swete as is the rote 
2,9,"of licorys, or any cetewale."
2,10,"his almageste and bokes grete and smale,"
2,11,"his astrelabie, longinge for his art,"
2,12,his augrim-stones layen faire a-part 
2,13,on shelves couched at his beddes heed:
2,14,his presse y-covered with a falding reed.
2,15,"and al above ther lay a gay sautrye,"
2,16,on which he made a nightes melodye
2,17,"so swetely, that al the chambre rong; "
2,18,and angelus ad virginem he song; 
2,19,and after that he song the kinges note;
2,20,ful often blessed was his mery throte.
2,21,and thus this swete clerk his tyme spente
2,22,after his freendes finding and his rente. 
2,0,
2,1,this carpenter had wedded newe a wyf
2,2,which that he lovede more than his lyf;
2,3,of eightetene yeer she was of age.
2,4,"ialous he was, and heeld hir narwe in cage,"
2,5,"for she was wilde and yong, and he was old "
2,6,and demed him-self ben lyk a cokewold. 
2,7,"he knew nat catoun, for his wit was rude,"
2,8,that bad man sholde wedde his similitude.
2,9,"men sholde wedden after hir estaat,"
2,10,for youthe and elde is often at debaat. 
2,11,"but sith that he was fallen in the snare,"
2,12,"he moste endure, as other folk, his care."
2,0,
2,1,"fair was this yonge wyf, and ther-with-al"
2,2,as any wesele hir body gent and smal.
2,3,"a ceynt she werede barred al of silk, "
2,4,a barmclooth eek as whyt as morne milk

3,9,for which this miller stal bothe mele and corn 
3,10,an hundred tyme more than biforn;

6,1,"a marchant whylom dwelled at seint denys,"
6,2,"that riche was, for which men helde him wys;"
6,3,"a wyf he hadde of excellent beautee,"
6,4,"and compaignable and revelous was she,"
6,5,which is a thing that causeth more dispence 
6,6,than worth is al the chere and reverence
6,7,that men hem doon at festes and at daunces;
6,8,swiche salutaciouns and contenaunces
6,9,passen as dooth a shadwe up-on the wal.
6,10,but wo is him that payen moot for al; 
6,11,"the sely housbond, algate he mot paye; "
6,12,"he moot us clothe, and he moot us arraye,"
6,13,"al for his owene worship richely,"
6,14,in which array we daunce iolily.
6,15,"and if that he noght may, par-aventure, "
6,16,"or elles, list no swich dispence endure,"
6,17,"but thinketh it is wasted and y-lost,"

6,2,for which he hadde alday so greet repair 
6,3,"for his largesse, and for his wyf was fair,"
6,4,that wonder is; but herkneth to my tale.
6,5,"amonges alle his gestes, grete and smale,"

6,12,that in his hous as famulier was he 
6,13,as it possible is any freend to be.

6,6,"he yaf the lord, and sitthe al his meynee,"
6,7,"when that he cam, som maner honest thing;"
6,8,for which they were as glad of his coming 
6,9,"as fowel is fayn, whan that the sonne up-ryseth. "
6,10,"na more of this as now, for it suffyseth."
6,0,
6,1,"but so bifel, this marchant on a day"
6,2,shoop him to make redy his array
6,3,"toward the toun of brugges for to fare, "
6,4,to byën ther a porcioun of ware;

12,0,
12,1,here biginneth the pardoners tale.
12,0,
12,1,in flaundres whylom was a companye
12,2,"of yonge folk, that haunteden folye,"
12,3,"as ryot, hasard, stewes, and tavernes, "
12,4,"wher-as, with harpes, lutes, and giternes,"

12,14,and ech of hem at otheres sinne lough.
12,15,and right anon than comen tombesteres

12,17,"singers with harpes, baudes, wafereres,"
12,18,whiche been the verray develes officeres 
12,19,"to kindle and blowe the fyr of lecherye,"
12,20,that is annexed un-to glotonye;
12,21,"the holy writ take i to my witnesse,"
12,22,that luxurie is in wyn and dronkenesse.
12,0,
12,1,"lo, how that dronken loth, unkindely, "
12,2,"lay by his doghtres two, unwitingly;"
12,3,"so dronke he was, he niste what he wroghte."
12,0,
12,1,"herodes, who-so wel the stories soghte, "
12,2,"whan he of wyn was replet at his feste,"
12,3,right at his owene table he yaf his heste

12,3,bitwix a man that is out of his minde
12,4,"and a man which that is dronkelewe, "
12,5,"but that woodnesse, y-fallen in a shrewe,"
12,6,persevereth lenger than doth dronkenesse.
12,7,"o glotonye, ful of cursednesse, "
12,8,"o cause first of our confusioun,"
12,9,"o original of our dampnacioun, "
12,10,til crist had boght us with his blood agayn!
12,11,"lo, how dere, shortly for to sayn,"
12,12,aboght was thilke cursed vileinye;
12,13,corrupt was al this world for glotonye!
12,0,
12,1,"adam our fader, and his wyf also, "
12,2,fro paradys to labour and to wo
12,3,"were driven for that vyce, it is no drede;"
12,4,"for whyl that adam fasted, as i rede, "
12,5,he was in paradys; and whan that he
12,6,"eet of the fruyt defended on the tree, "
12,7,anon he was out-cast to wo and peyne.
12,8,"o glotonye, on thee wel oghte us pleyne!"
12,9,"o, wiste a man how many maladyes"
12,10,"folwen of excesse and of glotonyes,"
12,11,he wolde been the more mesurable

12,13,"allas! the shorte throte, the tendre mouth,"
12,14,"maketh that, est and west, and north and south, "
12,15,"in erthe, in eir, in water men to-swinke"

12,17,"of this matere, o paul, wel canstow trete,"
12,18,"'mete un-to wombe, and wombe eek un-to mete,"
12,19,"shal god destroyen bothe,' as paulus seith."
12,20,"allas! a foul thing is it, by my feith,"
12,21,"to seye this word, and fouler is the dede, "
12,22,"whan man so drinketh of the whyte and rede,"
12,23,"that of his throte he maketh his privee,"
12,24,thurgh thilke cursed superfluitee. 
12,0,
12,1,"the apostel weping seith ful pitously,"
12,2,"'ther walken many of whiche yow told have i, "

12,6,"o wombe! o bely! o stinking cod,"
12,7,fulfild of donge and of corrupcioun! 
12,8,at either ende of thee foul is the soun.
12,9,how greet labour and cost is thee to finde!
12,10,"thise cokes, how they stampe, and streyne, and grinde, "

12,17,"shal been his sauce y-maked by delyt, "
12,18,to make him yet a newer appetyt.
12,19,"but certes, he that haunteth swich delyces"
12,20,"is deed, whyl that he liveth in tho vyces. "
12,0,
12,1,"a lecherous thing is wyn, and dronkenesse"
12,2,is ful of stryving and of wrecchednesse. 
12,3,"o dronke man, disfigured is thy face,"
12,4,"sour is thy breeth, foul artow to embrace,"
12,5,and thurgh thy dronke nose semeth the soun
12,6,"as though thou seydest ay 'sampsoun, sampsoun';"
12,7,"and yet, god wot, sampsoun drank never no wyn. "
12,8,"thou fallest, as it were a stiked swyn;"
12,9,"thy tonge is lost, and al thyn honest cure;"
12,10,for dronkenesse is verray sepulture 
12,11,of mannes wit and his discrecioun.
12,12,"in whom that drinke hath dominacioun, "
12,13,"he can no conseil kepe, it is no drede."
12,14,"now kepe yow fro the whyte and fro the rede,"
12,15,"and namely fro the whyte wyn of lepe,"
12,16,that is to selle in fish-strete or in chepe.
12,17,this wyn of spayne crepeth subtilly 
12,18,"in othere wynes, growing faste by,"
12,19,"of which ther ryseth swich fumositee,"
12,20,"that whan a man hath dronken draughtes three, "
12,21,"and weneth that he be at hoom in chepe,"
12,22,"he is in spayne, right at the toune of lepe, "
12,23,"nat at the rochel, ne at burdeux toun;"
12,24,"and thanne wol he seye, 'sampsoun, sampsoun.'"
12,0,
12,1,"but herkneth, lordings, o word, i yow preye,"
12,2,"that alle the sovereyn actes, dar i seye,"
12,3,"of victories in the olde testament, "
12,4,"thurgh verray god, that is omnipotent,"
12,5,were doon in abstinence and in preyere;
12,6,"loketh the bible, and ther ye may it lere. "
12,0,
12,1,"loke, attila, the grete conquerour,"
12,2,"deyde in his sleep, with shame and dishonour, "
12,3,bledinge ay at his nose in dronkenesse;
12,4,a capitayn shoulde live in sobrenesse.
12,5,"and over al this, avyseth yow right wel"
12,6,what was comaunded un-to lamuel—
12,7,"nat samuel, but lamuel, seye i—- "
12,8,"redeth the bible, and finde it expresly"
12,9,of wyn-yeving to hem that han iustyse.
12,10,"na-more of this, for it may wel suffyse. "
12,0,
12,1,"and now that i have spoke of glotonye,"
12,2,now wol i yow defenden hasardrye. 
12,3,"hasard is verray moder of lesinges,"
12,4,"and of deceite, and cursed forsweringes,"
12,5,"blaspheme of crist, manslaughtre, and wast also"
12,6,"of catel and of tyme; and forthermo,"
12,7,it is repreve and contrarie of honour 
12,8,for to ben holde a commune hasardour.
12,9,"and ever the hyër he is of estaat,"
12,10,the more is he holden desolaat. 
12,11,"if that a prince useth hasardrye,"
12,12,in alle governaunce and policye 
12,13,"he is, as by commune opinioun,"
12,14,y-holde the lasse in reputacioun.
12,0,
12,1,"stilbon, that was a wys embassadour,"
12,2,"was sent to corinthe, in ful greet honour,"
12,3,"fro lacidomie, to make hir alliaunce. "
12,4,"and whan he cam, him happede, par chaunce,"
12,5,"that alle the grettest that were of that lond,"
12,6,pleyinge atte hasard he hem fond. 
12,7,"for which, as sone as it mighte be,"
12,8,"he stal him hoom agayn to his contree, "
12,9,"and seyde, 'ther wol i nat lese my name;"
12,10,"ne i wol nat take on me so greet defame,"
12,11,yow for to allye un-to none hasardours.
12,12,sendeth othere wyse embassadours;
12,13,"for, by my trouthe, me were lever dye, "
12,14,than i yow sholde to hasardours allye.
12,15,for ye that been so glorious in honours
12,16,shul nat allyen yow with hasardours 
12,17,"as by my wil, ne as by my tretee.'"
12,18,this wyse philosophre thus seyde he. 
12,0,
12,1,"loke eek that, to the king demetrius"
12,2,"the king of parthes, as the book seith us,"
12,3,"sente him a paire of dees of gold in scorn,"
12,4,for he hadde used hasard ther-biforn;
12,5,for which he heeld his glorie or his renoun 
12,6,at no value or reputacioun.
12,7,lordes may finden other maner pley
12,8,honeste y-nough to dryve the day awey. 
12,0,
12,1,now wol i speke of othes false and grete
12,2,"a word or two, as olde bokes trete. "
12,3,"gret swering is a thing abhominable,"
12,4,and false swering is yet more reprevable.
12,5,"the heighe god forbad swering at al,"
12,6,witnesse on mathew; but in special
12,7,"of swering seith the holy ieremye, "
12,8,"'thou shalt seye sooth thyn othes, and nat lye,"
12,9,"and swere in dome, and eek in rightwisnesse;'"
12,10,but ydel swering is a cursednesse. 
12,11,"bihold and see, that in the firste table"
12,12,"of heighe goddes hestes honurable, "
12,13,how that the seconde heste of him is this—
12,14,'tak nat my name in ydel or amis.'
12,15,"lo, rather he forbedeth swich swering"
12,16,than homicyde or many a cursed thing;
12,17,"i seye that, as by ordre, thus it stondeth; "
12,18,"this knowen, that his hestes understondeth,"
12,19,how that the second heste of god is that.
12,20,"and forther over, i wol thee telle al plat, "
12,21,"that vengeance shal nat parten from his hous,"
12,22,that of his othes is to outrageous. 
12,23,"'by goddes precious herte, and by his nayles,"
12,24,"and by the blode of crist, that it is in hayles,"
12,25,"seven is my chaunce, and thyn is cink and treye;"
12,26,"by goddes armes, if thou falsly pleye,"
12,27,this dagger shal thurgh-out thyn herte go'— 
12,28,"this fruyt cometh of the bicched bones two,"
12,29,"forswering, ire, falsnesse, homicyde."
12,30,"now, for the love of crist that for us dyde, "
12,31,"leveth your othes, bothe grete and smale;"
12,32,"but, sirs, now wol i telle forth my tale. "
12,0,
12,1,"thise ryotoures three, of whiche i telle,"
12,2,"longe erst er pryme rong of any belle,"
12,3,were set hem in a taverne for to drinke;
12,4,"and as they satte, they herde a belle clinke"
12,5,"biforn a cors, was caried to his grave; "
12,6,"that oon of hem gan callen to his knave,"
12,7,"'go bet,' quod he, 'and axe redily,"
12,8,what cors is this that passeth heer forby; 
12,9,and look that thou reporte his name wel.'
12,0,
12,1,"'sir,' quod this boy, 'it nedeth never-a-del. "
12,2,"it was me told, er ye cam heer, two houres;"
12,3,"he was, pardee, an old felawe of youres;"
12,4,"and sodeynly he was y-slayn to-night,"
12,5,"for-dronke, as he sat on his bench upright;"
12,6,"ther cam a privee theef, men clepeth deeth, "
12,7,"that in this contree al the peple sleeth,"
12,8,"and with his spere he smoot his herte a-two,"
12,9,and wente his wey with-outen wordes mo. 
12,10,he hath a thousand slayn this pestilence:
12,11,"and, maister, er ye come in his presence, "
12,12,me thinketh that it were necessarie

12,4,i made him of the same wode a croce;
12,5,"nat of my body in no foul manere, "
12,6,"but certeinly, i made folk swich chere,"
12,7,that in his owene grece i made him frye
12,8,"for angre, and for verray ialousye."
12,9,"by god, in erthe i was his purgatorie,"
12,10,for which i hope his soule be in glorie. 
12,11,"for god it woot, he sat ful ofte and song"
12,12,whan that his shoo ful bitterly him wrong.
12,13,"ther was no wight, save god and he, that wiste,"
12,14,"in many wyse, how sore i him twiste."
12,15,"he deyde whan i cam fro ierusalem, "
12,16,"and lyth y-grave under the rode-beem,"
12,17,al is his tombe noght so curious
12,18,"as was the sepulcre of him, darius,"
12,19,which that appelles wroghte subtilly;
12,20,it nis but wast to burie him preciously. 
12,21,"lat him fare-wel, god yeve his soule reste,"
12,22,he is now in the grave and in his cheste.
12,0,
12,1,now of my fifthe housbond wol i telle.
12,2,god lete his soule never come in helle!
12,3,and yet was he to me the moste shrewe; 
12,4,"that fele i on my ribbes al by rewe,"
12,5,"and ever shal, un-to myn ending-day."
12,6,"but in our bed he was so fresh and gay,"
12,7,"and ther-with-al so wel coude he me glose,"
12,8,"whan that he wolde han my bele chose, "
12,9,"that thogh he hadde me bet on every boon,"
12,10,he coude winne agayn my love anoon.
12,11,"i trowe i loved him beste, for that he"
12,12,was of his love daungerous to me.
12,13,"we wommen han, if that i shal nat lye, "
12,14,in this matere a queynte fantasye;
12,15,"wayte what thing we may nat lightly have,"
12,16,ther-after wol we crye al-day and crave.
12,17,"forbede us thing, and that desyren we;"
12,18,"prees on us faste, and thanne wol we flee. "
12,19,with daunger oute we al our chaffare;
12,20,"greet prees at market maketh dere ware,"
12,21,and to greet cheep is holde at litel prys;
12,22,this knoweth every womman that is wys.
12,0,
12,1,"my fifthe housbonde, god his soule blesse! "
12,2,"which that i took for love and no richesse,"
12,3,"he som-tyme was a clerk of oxenford,"

12,10,"for had myn housbonde pissed on a wal,"
12,11,"or doon a thing that sholde han cost his lyf, "
12,12,"to hir, and to another worthy wyf,"
12,13,"and to my nece, which that i loved weel,"
12,14,i wolde han told his conseil every-deel.
12,15,"and so i dide ful often, god it woot,"
12,16,that made his face ful often reed and hoot 
12,17,"for verray shame, and blamed him-self for he"
12,18,had told to me so greet a privetee.
12,0,
12,1,"and so bifel that ones, in a lente,"
12,2,"so often tymes i to my gossib wente,"

12,5,"fro hous to hous, to here sondry talis,"
12,6,"that iankin clerk, and my gossib dame alis,"
12,7,"and i my-self, in-to the feldes wente."
12,8,myn housbond was at london al that lente; 
12,9,"i hadde the bettre leyser for to pleye,"
12,10,"and for to see, and eek for to be seye"
12,11,of lusty folk; what wiste i wher my grace
12,12,"was shapen for to be, or in what place?"
12,13,"therefore i made my visitaciouns, "

12,5,"i spak to him, and seyde him, how that he,"
12,6,"if i were widwe, sholde wedde me."
12,7,"for certeinly, i sey for no bobance,"
12,8,yet was i never with-outen purveyance 
12,9,"of mariage, nof othere thinges eek."
12,10,"i holde a mouses herte nat worth a leek,"
12,11,"that hath but oon hole for to sterte to,"
12,12,"and if that faille, thanne is al y-do."
12,0,
12,1,"i bar him on honde, he hadde enchanted me; "
12,2,my dame taughte me that soutiltee.
12,3,"and eek i seyde, i mette of him al night;"
12,4,"he wolde han slayn me as i lay up-right,"
12,5,"and al my bed was ful of verray blood,"
12,6,but yet i hope that he shal do me good; 
12,7,"for blood bitokeneth gold, as me was taught."
12,8,"and al was fals, i dremed of it right naught,"
12,9,"but as i folwed ay my dames lore,"
12,10,as wel of this as of other thinges more.
12,0,
12,1,"but now sir, lat me see, what i shal seyn? "
12,2,"a! ha! by god, i have my tale ageyn."

12,4,and with my coverchief covered my visage; 
12,5,"but for that i was purveyed of a make,"
12,6,"i weep but smal, and that i undertake."
12,0,
12,1,to chirche was myn housbond born a-morwe
12,2,"with neighebores, that for him maden sorwe;"
12,3,and iankin oure clerk was oon of tho. 
12,4,"as help me god, whan that i saugh him go"
12,5,"after the bere, me thoughte he hadde a paire"
12,6,"of legges and of feet so clene and faire,"
12,7,that al myn herte i yaf un-to his hold.
12,8,"he was, i trowe, a twenty winter old, "
12,9,"and i was fourty, if i shal seye sooth;"
12,10,but yet i hadde alwey a coltes tooth.
12,11,"gat-tothed i was, and that bicam me weel;"
12,12,i hadde the prente of sëynt venus seel.
12,13,"as help me god, i was a lusty oon, "
12,14,"and faire and riche, and yong, and wel bigoon;"
12,15,"and trewely, as myne housbondes tolde me,"
12,16,i had the beste quoniam mighte be.
12,17,"for certes, i am al venerien"
12,18,"in felinge, and myn herte is marcien. "
12,19,"venus me yaf my lust, my likerousnesse,"
12,20,and mars yaf me my sturdy hardinesse.
12,21,"myn ascendent was taur, and mars ther-inne."
12,22,allas! allas! that ever love was sinne!
12,23,i folwed ay myn inclinacioun 
12,24,by vertu of my constellacioun;

12,27,"yet have i martes mark up-on my face,"
12,28,and also in another privee place. 
12,29,"for, god so wis be my savacioun,"
12,30,"i ne loved never by no discrecioun,"
12,31,"but ever folwede myn appetyt,"
12,32,"al were he short or long, or blak or whyt;"

12,0,
12,1,"what sholde i seye, but, at the monthes ende,"
12,2,"this ioly clerk iankin, that was so hende,"
12,3,"hath wedded me with greet solempnitee,"
12,4,and to him yaf i al the lond and fee 
12,5,that ever was me yeven ther-bifore;
12,6,but afterward repented me ful sore.
12,7,he nolde suffre nothing of my list.
12,8,"by god, he smoot me ones on the list,"
12,9,"for that i rente out of his book a leef, "

12,15,"for which he often tymes wolde preche,"
12,16,"and me of olde romayn gestes teche,"
12,17,"how he, simplicius gallus, lefte his wyf,"
12,18,"and hir forsook for terme of al his lyf,"

12,13,"but al for noght, i sette noght an hawe"

12,18,this made him with me wood al outrely;

12,17,to reden on this book of wikked wyves. 
12,18,he knew of hem mo legendes and lyves
12,19,than been of gode wyves in the bible.
12,20,"for trusteth wel, it is an impossible"

17,1,here biginneth the marchantes tale.
17,0,
17,1,whylom ther was dwellinge in lumbardye 
17,2,"a worthy knight, that born was of pavye,"
17,3,in which he lived in greet prosperitee;
17,4,"and sixty yeer a wyflees man was he,"
17,5,and folwed ay his bodily delyt
17,6,"on wommen, ther-as was his appetyt, "
17,7,as doon thise foles that ben seculeer.
17,8,"and whan that he was passed sixty yeer,"
17,9,"were it for holinesse or for dotage,"
17,10,"i can nat seye, but swich a greet corage "
17,11,"hadde this knight to been a wedded man, "

17,18,"with which that first god man and womman bond,"
17,19,"'non other lyf,' seyde he, 'is worth a bene;"
17,20,"for wedlok is so esy and so clene, "
17,21,that in this world it is a paradys.' 
17,22,"thus seyde this olde knight, that was so wys."
17,0,
17,1,"and certeinly, as sooth as god is king,"
17,2,"to take a wyf, it is a glorious thing,"
17,3,and namely whan a man is old and hoor;
17,4,thanne is a wyf the fruit of his tresor. 
17,5,"than sholde he take a yong wyf and a feir,"
17,6,"on which he mighte engendren him an heir,"
17,7,"and lede his lyf in ioye and in solas,"
17,8,"wher-as thise bacheleres singe 'allas,' "
17,9,whan that they finden any adversitee 
17,10,"in love, which nis but childish vanitee."
17,11,"and trewely it sit wel to be so,"
17,12,that bacheleres have often peyne and wo;
17,13,"on brotel ground they builde, and brotelnesse"
17,14,"they finde, whan they wene sikernesse. "
17,15,"they live but as a brid or as a beste,"
17,16,"in libertee, and under non areste,"

17,19,under the yok of mariage y-bounde; 
17,20,wel may his herte in ioye and blisse habounde.
17,21,for who can be so buxom as a wyf?
17,22,"who is so trewe, and eek so ententyf"
17,23,"to kepe him, syk and hool, as is his make?"
17,24,"for wele or wo, she wol him nat forsake. "
17,25,"she nis nat wery him to love and serve,"
17,26,thogh that he lye bedrede til he sterve.
17,27,"and yet somme clerkes seyn, it nis nat so,"
17,28,"of whiche he, theofraste, is oon of tho. "
17,29,what force though theofraste liste lye? 
17,30,"'ne take no wyf,' quod he, 'for housbondrye,"

17,34,for she wol clayme half part al hir lyf;

19,3,to serve a lady in his beste wyse;
19,4,"and many a labour, many a greet empryse"
19,5,"he for his lady wroghte, er she were wonne."

19,10,"but atte laste, she, for his worthinesse, "
19,11,"and namely for his meke obeysaunce,"
19,12,"hath swich a pitee caught of his penaunce, "
19,13,that prively she fil of his accord
19,14,"to take him for hir housbonde and hir lord,"
19,15,of swich lordshipe as men han over hir wyves;
19,16,"and for to lede the more in blisse hir lyves,"
19,17,"of his free wil he swoor hir as a knight, "
19,18,"that never in al his lyf he, day ne night,"
19,19,ne sholde up-on him take no maistrye
19,20,"agayn hir wil, ne kythe hir ialousye, "
19,21,"but hir obeye, and folwe hir wil in al"
19,22,as any lovere to his lady shal; 
19,23,"save that the name of soveraynetee,"
19,24,that wolde he have for shame of his degree.
19,0,
19,1,"she thanked him, and with ful greet humblesse"
19,2,"she seyde, 'sire, sith of your gentillesse"
19,3,"ye profre me to have so large a reyne, "

19,13,pacience is an heigh vertu certeyn;

19,19,"for in this world, certein, ther no wight is,"

19,6,sith he hath bothe his lady and his love;
19,7,"his lady, certes, and his wyf also,"
19,8,the which that lawe of love acordeth to. 
19,9,"and whan he was in this prosperitee,"
19,10,"hoom with his wyf he gooth to his contree, "
19,11,"nat fer fro penmark, ther his dwelling was,"

19,2,"and speken i wole of dorigene his wyf, "
19,3,that loveth hir housbonde as hir hertes lyf.
19,4,"for his absence wepeth she and syketh,"
19,5,as doon thise noble wyves whan hem lyketh. 
19,6,"she moorneth, waketh, wayleth, fasteth, pleyneth;"
19,7,"desyr of his presence hir so distreyneth, "
19,8,that al this wyde world she sette at noght.
19,9,"hir frendes, whiche that knewe hir hevy thoght,"
19,10,conforten hir in al that ever they may;
19,11,"they prechen hir, they telle hir night and day,"
19,12,"that causelees she sleeth hir-self, allas! "
19,13,and every confort possible in this cas
19,14,"they doon to hir with al hir bisinesse,"
19,15,al for to make hir leve hir hevinesse. 
19,0,
19,1,"by proces, as ye knowen everichoon,"
19,2,"men may so longe graven in a stoon, "
19,3,til som figure ther-inne emprented be.
19,4,"so longe han they conforted hir, til she"
19,5,"receyved hath, by hope and by resoun,"

19,7,thurgh which hir grete sorwe gan aswage; 
19,8,she may nat alwey duren in swich rage.
19,0,
19,1,"and eek arveragus, in al this care,"

19,2,"and preyede hir on knees, for goddes sake,"
19,3,"to come and romen hir in companye,"
19,4,awey to dryve hir derke fantasye.
19,5,"and finally, she graunted that requeste; "
19,6,for wel she saugh that it was for the beste.
19,0,
19,1,"now stood hir castel faste by the see,"
19,2,and often with hir freendes walketh she 
19,3,"hir to disporte up-on the bank an heigh,"
19,4,wher-as she many a ship and barge seigh 
19,5,"seilinge hir cours, wher-as hem liste go;"
19,6,but than was that a parcel of hir wo.
19,7,"for to hir-self ful ofte 'allas!' seith she,"
19,8,"'is ther no ship, of so manye as i see,"
19,9,wol bringen hom my lord? than were myn herte

19,0,
19,1,"another tyme ther wolde she sitte and thinke,"
19,2,and caste hir eyen dounward fro the brinke. 
19,3,"but whan she saugh the grisly rokkes blake,"
19,4,"for verray fere so wolde hir herte quake, "
19,5,that on hir feet she mighte hir noght sustene.
19,6,"than wolde she sitte adoun upon the grene,"
19,7,"and pitously in-to the see biholde,"
19,8,"and seyn right thus, with sorweful sykes colde:"
19,0,
19,1,"'eterne god, that thurgh thy purveyaunce "
19,2,"ledest the world by certein governaunce,"
19,3,"in ydel, as men seyn, ye no-thing make;"
19,4,"but, lord, thise grisly feendly rokkes blake, "
19,5,that semen rather a foul confusioun

19,7,"of swich a parfit wys god and a stable,"
19,8,why han ye wroght this werk unresonable?
19,9,"for by this werk, south, north, ne west, ne eest,"
19,10,"ther nis y-fostred man, ne brid, ne beest;"
19,11,"it dooth no good, to my wit, but anoyeth. "
19,12,"see ye nat, lord, how mankinde it destroyeth?"
19,13,an hundred thousand bodies of mankinde

19,20,"whiche menes do no good, but ever anoyen?"
19,21,"i wool wel clerkes wol seyn, as hem leste, "

19,29,thise rokkes sleen myn herte for the fere.'
19,30,"thus wolde she seyn, with many a pitous tere."
19,0,
19,1,hir freendes sawe that it was no disport

21,6,"right as him liste, the preest he made his ape; "
21,7,"and afterward in the ingot he it caste,"
21,8,and in the panne putte it at the laste 
21,9,"of water, and in he putte his owene hond."
21,10,and in his sleve as ye biforn-hond
21,11,herde me telle he hadde a silver teyne.
21,12,"he slyly took it out, this cursed heyne—"
21,13,unwiting this preest of his false craft— 
21,14,and in the pannes botme he hath it laft;
21,15,"and in the water rombled to and fro,"
21,16,and wonder prively took up also 
21,17,"the coper teyne, noght knowing this preest,"
21,18,"and hidde it, and him hente by the breest, "
21,19,"and to him spak, and thus seyde in his game,"
21,20,"'stoupeth adoun, by god, ye be to blame,"
21,21,"helpeth me now, as i dide yow whyl-er,"
21,22,"putte in your hand, and loketh what is ther.'"
21,0,
21,1,"this preest took up this silver teyne anon, "
21,2,"and thanne seyde the chanoun, 'lat us gon"
21,3,"with thise three teynes, which that we han wroght,"
21,4,"to som goldsmith, and wite if they been oght. "
21,5,"for, by my feith, i nolde, for myn hood,"
21,6,"but-if that they were silver, fyn and good, "
21,7,and that as swythe preved shal it be.'
21,0,
21,1,un-to the goldsmith with thise teynes three
21,2,"they wente, and putte thise teynes in assay"
21,3,"to fyr and hamer; mighte no man sey nay,"
21,4,but that they weren as hem oghte be. 
21,0,
21,1,"this sotted preest, who was gladder than he?"
21,2,"was never brid gladder agayn the day,"
21,3,"ne nightingale, in the sesoun of may, "
21,4,nas never noon that luste bet to singe;

21,8,"to stonde in grace of his lady dere,"
21,9,than had this preest this sory craft to lere;
21,10,"and to the chanoun thus he spak and seyde, "
21,11,"'for love of god, that for us alle deyde,"
21,12,"and as i may deserve it un-to yow,"
21,13,what shal this receit coste? telleth now!' 
21,0,
21,1,"'by our lady,' quod this chanoun, 'it is dere,"

21,2,"of nobles fette, and took hem everichon "
21,3,"to this chanoun, for this ilke receit;"
21,4,al his werking nas but fraude and deceit.
21,0,
21,1,"'sir preest,' he seyde, 'i kepe han no loos"
21,2,"of my craft, for i wolde it kept were cloos;"
21,3,"and as ye love me, kepeth it secree; "
21,4,"for, and men knewe al my subtilitee,"
21,5,"by god, they wolden han so greet envye"

21,0,
21,1,"'for your good wil, sir, have ye right good preef,'"
21,2,"quod the chanoun, 'and far-wel, grant mercy!' "
21,3,he wente his wey and never the preest him sy

21,6,"of this receit, far-wel! it wolde nat be!"
21,7,"lo, thus byiaped and bigyled was he! "
21,8,thus maketh he his introduccioun
21,9,to bringe folk to hir destruccioun.—
21,0,
21,1,"considereth, sirs, how that, in ech estaat,"
21,2,bitwixe men and gold ther is debaat
21,3,"so ferforth, that unnethes is ther noon. "
21,4,"this multiplying blent so many oon,"
21,5,that in good feith i trowe that it be
21,6,the cause grettest of swich scarsetee. 
21,7,philosophres speken so mistily
21,8,"in this craft, that men can nat come therby, "
21,9,for any wit that men han now a-dayes.
21,10,"they mowe wel chiteren, as doon thise iayes,"
21,11,"and in her termes sette hir lust and peyne,"
21,12,but to hir purpos shul they never atteyne.
21,13,"a man may lightly lerne, if he have aught, "
21,14,"to multiplye, and bringe his good to naught!"
21,0,
21,1,"lo! swich a lucre is in this lusty game,"
21,2,"a mannes mirthe it wol torne un-to grame, "
21,3,"and empten also grete and hevy purses,"
21,4,and maken folk for to purchasen curses 
21,5,"of hem, that han hir good therto y-lent."
21,6,"o! fy! for shame! they that han been brent,"
21,7,allas! can they nat flee the fyres hete?
21,8,"ye that it use, i rede ye it lete,"
21,9,lest ye lese al; for bet than never is late. 
21,10,never to thryve were to long a date.
21,11,"though ye prolle ay, ye shul it never finde;"
21,12,"ye been as bolde as is bayard the blinde, "
21,13,"that blundreth forth, and peril casteth noon;"
21,14,he is as bold to renne agayn a stoon 
21,15,as for to goon besydes in the weye.
21,16,"so faren ye that multiplye, i seye."
21,17,"if that your yën can nat seen aright,"
21,18,loke that your minde lakke nought his sight.
21,19,"for, though ye loke never so brode, and stare, "
21,20,"ye shul nat winne a myte on that chaffare,"
21,21,but wasten al that ye may rape and renne.
21,22,"withdrawe the fyr, lest it to faste brenne; "
21,23,"medleth na-more with that art, i mene,"
21,24,"for, if ye doon, your thrift is goon ful clene. "
21,25,"and right as swythe i wol yow tellen here,"
21,26,what philosophres seyn in this matere.
21,0,
21,1,"lo, thus seith arnold of the newe toun,"
21,2,as his rosarie maketh mencioun;
21,3,"he seith right thus, with-outen any lye, "
21,4,"'ther may no man mercurie mortifye,"
21,5,but it be with his brother knowleching.
21,6,"how that he, which that first seyde this thing, "
21,7,"of philosophres fader was, hermes;"
21,8,"he seith, how that the dragoun, doutelees, "
21,9,"ne deyeth nat, but-if that he be slayn"
21,10,"with his brother; and that is for to sayn,"
21,11,"by the dragoun, mercurie and noon other"
21,12,"he understood; and brimstoon by his brother,"
21,13,that out of sol and luna were y-drawe. 
21,14,"and therfor,' seyde he, 'tak heed to my sawe,"
21,15,"let no man bisy him this art for to seche,"
21,16,but-if that he thentencioun and speche 
21,17,of philosophres understonde can;
21,18,"and if he do, he is a lewed man. "
21,19,"for this science and this conning,' quod he,"
21,20,"'is of the secree of secrees, parde.'"
21,0,
21,1,"also ther was a disciple of plato,"
21,2,"that on a tyme seyde his maister to,"
21,3,"as his book senior wol bere witnesse, "
21,4,and this was his demande in soothfastnesse:
21,5,'tel me the name of the privy stoon?'
21,0,
21,1,"and plato answerde unto him anoon, "
21,2,'tak the stoon that titanos men name.'
21,0,
21,1,"'which is that?' quod he. 'magnesia is the same,' "
21,2,"seyde plato. 'ye, sir, and is it thus?"
21,3,this is ignotum per ignotius.
21,4,"what is magnesia, good sir, i yow preye?'"
21,0,
21,1,"'it is a water that is maad, i seye,"
21,2,"of elementes foure,' quod plato. "
21,0,
21,1,"'tel me the rote, good sir,' quod he tho,"
21,2,"'of that water, if that it be your wille?'"
21,0,
21,1,"'nay, nay,' quod plato, 'certein, that i nille. "
21,2,"the philosophres sworn were everichoon,"
21,3,"that they sholden discovere it un-to noon, "
21,4,ne in no book it wryte in no manere;
21,5,for un-to crist it is so leef and dere
21,6,"that he wol nat that it discovered be,"
21,7,but wher it lyketh to his deitee
21,8,"man for tenspyre, and eek for to defende "
21,9,"whom that him lyketh; lo, this is the ende.'"
21,0,
21,1,thanne conclude i thus; sith god of hevene
21,2,ne wol nat that the philosophres nevene 
21,3,"how that a man shal come un-to this stoon,"
21,4,"i rede, as for the beste, lete it goon. "
21,5,"for who-so maketh god his adversarie,"
21,6,as for to werken any thing in contrarie
21,7,"of his wil, certes, never shal he thryve,"
21,8,thogh that he multiplye terme of his lyve.
21,9,and ther a poynt; for ended is my tale; 
21,10,god sende every trewe man bote of his bale!—amen. 
21,0,
21,1,here is ended the chanouns yemannes tale.
21,0,
21,1,
21,2,here folweth the prologe of the maunciples tale.
21,0,
21,1,wite ye nat wher ther stant a litel toun
21,2,"which that y-cleped is bob-up-and-doun,"
21,3,"under the blee, in caunterbury weye?"
21,4,"ther gan our hoste for to iape and pleye,"
21,5,"and seyde, 'sirs, what! dun is in the myre!"
21,6,"is ther no man, for preyere ne for hyre,"
21,7,that wol awake our felawe heer bihinde?
21,8,a theef mighte him ful lightly robbe and binde.
21,9,"see how he nappeth! see, for cokkes bones,"
21,10,as he wol falle from his hors at ones.
21,11,"is that a cook of londoun, with meschaunce?"
21,12,"do him come forth, he knoweth his penaunce,"
21,13,"for he shal telle a tale, by my fey!"
21,14,al-though it be nat worth a botel hey.
21,15,"awake, thou cook,' quod he, 'god yeve thee sorwe,"
21,16,what eyleth thee to slepe by the morwe?
21,17,"hastow had fleen al night, or artow dronke,"
21,18,"or hastow with som quene al night y-swonke,"
21,19,so that thou mayst nat holden up thyn heed?'
21,0,
21,1,"this cook, that was ful pale and no-thing reed, "
21,2,"seyde to our host, 'so god my soule blesse,"
21,3,"as ther is falle on me swich hevinesse,"
21,4,"noot i nat why, that me were lever slepe"
21,5,than the beste galoun wyn in chepe.'
21,0,
21,1,"'wel,' quod the maunciple, 'if it may doon ese "
21,2,"to thee, sir cook, and to no wight displese"
21,3,"which that heer rydeth in this companye,"
21,4,"and that our host wol, of his curteisye,"
21,5,i wol as now excuse thee of thy tale;
21,6,"for, in good feith, thy visage is ful pale, "
21,7,"thyn yën daswen eek, as that me thinketh,"
21,8,"and wel i woot, thy breeth ful soure stinketh,"
21,9,that sheweth wel thou art not wel disposed;
21,10,"of me, certein, thou shalt nat been y-glosed."
21,11,"se how he ganeth, lo, this dronken wight, "
21,12,as though he wolde us swolwe anon-right.
21,13,"hold cloos thy mouth, man, by thy fader kin!"
21,14,the devel of helle sette his foot ther-in!
21,15,thy cursed breeth infecte wol us alle;
21,16,"fy, stinking swyn, fy! foule moot thee falle! "
21,17,"a! taketh heed, sirs, of this lusty man."
21,18,"now, swete sir, wol ye iusten atte fan?"
21,19,ther-to me thinketh ye been wel y-shape!
21,20,"i trowe that ye dronken han wyn ape,"
21,21,and that is whan men pleyen with a straw.' 
21,22,"and with this speche the cook wex wrooth and wraw,"
21,23,and on the maunciple he gan nodde faste
21,24,"for lakke of speche, and doun the hors him caste,"
21,25,"wher as he lay, til that men up him took;"
21,26,this was a fayr chivachee of a cook! 
21,27,allas! he nadde holde him by his ladel!
21,28,"and, er that he agayn were in his sadel,"
21,29,"ther was greet showving bothe to and fro,"
21,30,"to lifte him up, and muchel care and wo,"
21,31,so unweldy was this sory palled gost. 
21,32,"and to the maunciple thanne spak our host,"
21,33,'by-cause drink hath dominacioun
21,34,"upon this man, by my savacioun"
21,35,i trowe he lewedly wolde telle his tale.
21,36,"for, were it wyn, or old or moysty ale, "
21,37,"that he hath dronke, he speketh in his nose,"
21,38,"and fneseth faste, and eek he hath the pose."
21,39,he hath also to do more than y-nough
21,40,to kepe him and his capel out of slough;
21,41,"and, if he falle from his capel eft-sone, "
21,42,"than shul we alle have y-nough to done,"
21,43,in lifting up his hevy dronken cors.
21,44,"telle on thy tale, of him make i no fors."
21,0,
21,1,"but yet, maunciple, in feith thou art to nyce,"
21,2,thus openly repreve him of his vyce. 
21,3,"another day he wol, peraventure,"
21,4,"reclayme thee, and bringe thee to lure;"
21,5,"i mene, he speke wol of smale thinges,"
21,6,"as for to pinchen at thy rekeninges,"
21,7,"that wer not honeste, if it cam to preef.' "
21,0,
21,1,"'no,' quod the maunciple, 'that were a greet mescheef!"
21,2,so mighte he lightly bringe me in the snare.
21,3,yet hadde i lever payen for the mare
21,4,"which he rit on, than he sholde with me stryve;"
21,5,"i wol nat wratthe him, al-so mote i thryve! "
21,6,"that that i spak, i seyde it in my bourde;"
21,7,"and wite ye what? i have heer, in a gourde,"
21,8,"a draught of wyn, ye, of a rype grape,"
21,9,and right anon ye shul seen a good iape.
21,10,"this cook shal drinke ther-of, if i may; "
21,11,"up peyne of deeth, he wol nat seye me nay!'"
21,0,
21,1,"and certeinly, to tellen as it was,"
21,2,"of this vessel the cook drank faste, allas!"
21,3,what neded him? he drank y-nough biforn.
21,4,"and whan he hadde pouped in this horn, "
21,5,to the maunciple he took the gourde agayn;
21,6,"and of that drinke the cook was wonder fayn,"
21,7,and thanked him in swich wyse as he coude.
21,0,
21,1,"than gan our host to laughen wonder loude,"
21,2,"and seyde, 'i see wel, it is necessarie, "
21,3,"wher that we goon, good drink we with us carie;"
21,4,for that wol turne rancour and disese
21,5,"tacord and love, and many a wrong apese."
21,0,
21,1,"o thou bachus, y-blessed be thy name,"
21,2,that so canst turnen ernest in-to game! 
21,3,worship and thank be to thy deitee!
21,4,of that matere ye gete na-more of me.
21,5,"tel on thy tale, maunciple, i thee preye.'"
21,0,
21,1,"'wel, sir,' quod he, 'now herkneth what i seye.'"
21,0,
21,1,thus endeth the prologe of the manciple.
21,0,
21,1,
22,0,
22,1,here biginneth the maunciples tale of the crowe.
22,0,
22,1,"whan phebus dwelled here in this erthe adoun, "
22,2,"as olde bokes maken mencioun,"
22,3,he was the moste lusty bachiler
22,4,"in al this world, and eek the beste archer;"
22,5,"he slow phitoun, the serpent, as he lay"
22,6,slepinge agayn the sonne upon a day; 
22,7,and many another noble worthy dede
22,8,"he with his bowe wroghte, as men may rede."
22,0,
22,1,"pleyen he coude on every minstralcye,"
22,2,"and singen, that it was a melodye, "
22,3,to heren of his clere vois the soun. 
22,4,"certes the king of thebes, amphioun,"
22,5,"that with his singing walled that citee,"
22,6,coude never singen half so wel as he.
22,7,therto he was the semelieste man
22,8,"that is or was, sith that the world bigan. "
22,9,what nedeth it his fetures to discryve?
22,10,for in this world was noon so fair on lyve.
22,11,"he was ther-with fulfild of gentillesse,"
22,12,"of honour, and of parfit worthinesse. "
22,0,
22,1,"this phebus, that was flour of bachelrye, "
22,2,"as wel in fredom as in chivalrye,"
22,3,"for his desport, in signe eek of victorie"
22,4,"of phitoun, so as telleth us the storie,"
22,5,was wont to beren in his hand a bowe.
22,0,
22,1,"now had this phebus in his hous a crowe, "
22,2,"which in a cage he fostred many a day,"
22,3,"and taughte it speken, as men teche a iay."
22,4,"whyt was this crowe, as is a snow-whyt swan,"
22,5,and countrefete the speche of every man 
22,6,"he coude, whan he sholde telle a tale. "
22,7,ther-with in al this world no nightingale
22,8,"ne coude, by an hondred thousand deel,"
22,9,singen so wonder merily and weel.
22,0,
22,1,"now had this phebus in his hous a wyf,"
22,2,"which that he lovede more than his lyf, "
22,3,and night and day dide ever his diligence
22,4,"hir for to plese, and doon hir reverence,"
22,5,"save only, if the sothe that i shal sayn,"
22,6,"ialous he was, and wolde have kept hir fayn; "
22,7,for him were looth by-iaped for to be. 
22,8,and so is every wight in swich degree;
22,9,"but al in ydel, for it availleth noght."
22,10,"a good wyf, that is clene of werk and thoght,"
22,11,"sholde nat been kept in noon await, certayn;"
22,12,"and trewely, the labour is in vayn "
22,13,"to kepe a shrewe, for it wol nat be."
22,14,"this holde i for a verray nycetee,"
22,15,"to spille labour, for to kepe wyves;"
22,16,thus writen olde clerkes in hir lyves. 
22,0,
22,1,"but now to purpos, as i first bigan: "
22,2,this worthy phebus dooth all that he can

22,4,"and for his manhede and his governaunce,"
22,5,that no man sholde han put him from hir grace.
22,6,"but god it woot, ther may no man embrace "
22,7,"as to destreyne a thing, which that nature"
22,8,hath naturelly set in a creature.
22,0,

22,2,and do al thyn entente and thy corage 
22,3,"to fostre it tendrely with mete and drinke, "
22,4,"of alle deyntees that thou canst bithinke,"
22,5,and keep it al-so clenly as thou may;
22,6,"al-though his cage of gold be never so gay,"
22,7,"yet hath this brid, by twenty thousand fold,"
22,8,"lever in a forest, that is rude and cold, "
22,9,gon ete wormes and swich wrecchednesse.
22,10,for ever this brid wol doon his bisinesse
22,11,"to escape out of his cage, if he may;"
22,12,his libertee this brid desireth ay. 
22,0,
22,1,"lat take a cat, and fostre him wel with milk, "
22,2,"and tendre flesh, and make his couche of silk,"
22,3,and lat him seen a mous go by the wal;
22,4,"anon he weyveth milk, and flesh, and al,"
22,5,"and every deyntee that is in that hous,"
22,6,swich appetyt hath he to ete a mous. 
22,7,"lo, here hath lust his dominacioun,"
22,8,and appetyt flemeth discrecioun.
22,0,
22,1,a she-wolf hath also a vileins kinde;
22,2,"the lewedeste wolf that she may finde, "
22,3,"or leest of reputacion wol she take, "
22,4,in tyme whan hir lust to han a make.
22,0,
22,1,alle thise ensamples speke i by thise men
22,2,"that been untrewe, and no-thing by wommen."
22,3,for men han ever a likerous appetyt
22,4,on lower thing to parfourne hir delyt 
22,5,"than on hir wyves, be they never so faire,"
22,6,"ne never so trewe, ne so debonaire."
22,7,"flesh is so newefangel, with meschaunce,"
22,8,that we ne conne in no-thing han plesaunce 
22,9,that souneth in-to vertu any whyle. 
22,0,
22,1,"this phebus, which that thoghte upon no gyle,"
22,2,"deceyved was, for al his iolitee;"
22,3,"for under him another hadde she,"
22,4,"a man of litel reputacioun,"
22,5,noght worth to phebus in comparisoun. 
22,6,"the more harm is; it happeth ofte so,"

22,0,
22,1,explicit prohemium.
22,0,
22,1,
22,0,
22,1,"state super vias et videte et interrogate de viis antiquis, que sit via bona; et ambulate in ea, et inuenietis refrigerium animabus vestris, &c."
22,2,"our swete lord god of hevene, that no man wole perisse, but wole that we comen alle to the knoweleche of him, and to the blisful lyf that is perdurable, /"
22,3,"seint ambrose seith, that 'penitence is the pleyninge of man for the gilt that he hath doon, and na-more to do any thing for which him oghte to pleyne.' / and som doctour seith: 'penitence is the waymentinge of man, that sorweth for his sinne and pyneth him-self for he hath misdoon.' /"
22,4,"and now, sith i have declared yow what thing is penitence, now shul ye understonde that ther been three accions of penitence. /"
22,5,"the spyces of penitence been three. that oon of hem is solempne, another is commune, and the thridde is privee. / thilke penance that is solempne, is in two maneres; as to be put out of holy chirche in lente, for slaughtre of children, and swich maner thing. / another is, whan a man hath sinned openly, of which sinne the fame is openly spoken in the contree; and thanne holy chirche by iugement destreineth him for to do open penaunce. / commune penaunce is that preestes enioinen men comunly in certeyn caas; as for to goon, peraventure, naked in pilgrimages, or bare-foot. /"
22,6,"now shaltow understande what is bihovely and necessarie to verray parfit penitence. and this stant on three thinges; / contricioun of herte, confessioun of mouth, and satisfaccioun. / for which seith seint iohn crisostom: 'penitence destreyneth a man to accepte benignely every peyne that him is enioyned, with contricion of herte, and shrift of mouth, with satisfaccion; and in werkinge of alle maner humilitee.' / and this is fruitful penitence agayn three thinges in whiche we wratthe oure lord iesu crist: /"
22,7,"the rote of this tree is contricion, that hydeth him in the herte of him that is verray repentant, right as the rote of a tree hydeth him in the erthe. / of the rote of contricion springeth a stalke, that bereth braunches and leves of confession, and fruit of satisfaccion. / for which crist seith in his gospel: 'dooth digne fruit of penitence'; for by this fruit may men knowe this tree, and nat by the rote that is hid in the herte of man, ne by the braunches ne by the leves of confession. /"
22,8,"in this penitence or contricion man shal understonde foure thinges, that is to seyn, what is contricion: and whiche been the causes that moeven a man to contricion: and how he sholde be contrit: and what contricion availleth to the soule. / thanne is it thus: that contricion is the verray sorwe that a man receiveth in his herte for his sinnes, with sad purpos to shryve him, and to do penaunce, and nevermore to do sinne. / and this sorwe shal been in this manere, as seith seint bernard: 'it shal been hevy and grevous, and ful sharpe and poinant in herte.' /"
22,9,"the causes that oghte moeve a man to contricion been six. first, a man shal remembre him of hise sinnes; / but loke he that thilke remembrance ne be to him no delyt by no wey, but greet shame and sorwe for his gilt. for iob seith: 'sinful men doon werkes worthy of confession.' / and therfore seith ezechie: 'i wol remembre me alle the yeres of my lyf, in bitternesse of myn herte.' /"
22,10,"the seconde cause that oghte make a man to have desdeyn of sinne is this: that, as seith seint peter, 'who-so that doth sinne is thral of sinne'; and sinne put a man in greet thraldom. / and therfore seith the prophete ezechiel: 'i wente sorweful in desdayn of my-self.' and certes, wel oghte a man have desdayn of sinne, and withdrawe him from that thraldom and vileinye. / and lo, what seith seneca in this matere. he seith thus: 'though i wiste that neither god ne man ne sholde nevere knowe it, yet wolde i have desdayn for to do sinne.' / and the same seneca also seith: 'i am born to gretter thinges than to be thral to my body, or than for to maken of my body a thral.' /"
22,11,"the thridde cause that oghte moeve a man to contricion, is drede of the day of dome, and of the horrible peynes of helle. / for as seint ierome seith: 'at every tyme that me remembreth of the day of dome, i quake; / for whan i ete or drinke, or what-so that i do, evere semeth me that the trompe sowneth in myn ere: /"
22,12,"the fourthe point, that oghte maken a man to have contricion, is the sorweful remembrance of the good that he hath left to doon here in erthe; and eek the good that he hath lorn. / soothly, the gode werkes that he hath left, outher they been the gode werkes that he wroghte er he fel in-to deedly sinne, or elles the gode werkes that he wroghte while he lay in sinne. / soothly, the gode werkes, that he dide biforn that he fil in sinne, been al mortified and astoned and dulled by the ofte sinning. / the othere gode werkes, that he wroghte whyl he lay in deedly sinne, they been outrely dede as to the lyf perdurable in hevene. / thanne thilke gode werkes that been mortified by ofte sinning, whiche gode werkes he dide whyl he was in charitee, ne mowe nevere quiken agayn with-outen verray penitence. /"
22,13,"the fifthe thing that oghte moeve a man to contricion, is remembrance of the passion that oure lord iesu crist suffred for our sinnes. /"
22,14,"the sixte thing that oghte moeve a man to contricion, is the hope of three thynges; that is to seyn, foryifnesse of sinne, and the yifte of grace wel for to do, and the glorie of hevene, with which god shal guerdone a man for hise gode dedes. / and for-as-muche as iesu crist yeveth us thise yiftes of his largesse and of his sovereyn bountee, therfore is he cleped iesus nazarenus rex iudeorum. / iesus is to seyn 'saveour' or 'salvacion,' on whom men shul hope to have foryifnesse of sinnes, which that is proprely salvacion of sinnes. /"
22,15,"now shal a man understonde, in which manere shal been his contricion. i seye, that it shal been universal and total; this is to seyn, a man shal be verray repentant for alle hise sinnes that he hath doon in delyt of his thoght; for delyt is ful perilous. / for ther been two manere of consentinges; that oon of hem is cleped consentinge of affeccion, when a man is moeved to do sinne, and delyteth him longe for to thinke on that sinne; / and his reson aperceyveth it wel, that it is sinne agayns the lawe of god, and yet his reson refreyneth nat his foul delyt or talent, though he se wel apertly that it is agayns the reverence of god; al-though his reson ne consente noght to doon that sinne in dede, / yet seyn somme doctours that swich delyt that dwelleth longe, it is ful perilous, al be it nevere so lite. /"
22,16,"the laste thing that man shal understonde in contricion is this; wher-of avayleth contricion. i seye, that som tyme contricion delivereth a man fro sinne; / of which that david seith: 'i seye,' quod david, that is to seyn, 'i purposed fermely to shryve me; and thow, lord, relesedest my sinne.' / and right so as contricion availleth noght, with-outen sad purpos of shrifte, if man have oportunitee, right so litel worth is shrifte or satisfaccion with-outen contricion. /"
22,17,explicit prima pars penitentie; et sequitur secunda pars eiusdem.
22,0,
22,1,"the seconde partie of penitence is confession, that is signe of contricion. / now shul ye understonde what is confession, and whether it oghte nedes be doon or noon, and whiche thinges been covenable to verray confession. /"
22,2,"first shaltow understonde that confession is verray shewinge of sinnes to the preest; / this is to seyn 'verray,' for he moste confessen him of alle the condiciouns that bilongen to his sinne, as ferforth as he can. / al moot be seyd, and no thing excused ne hid ne forwrapped, and noght avaunte him of his gode werkes. /"
22,3,"of the springinge of sinnes seith seint paul in this wise: that 'right as by a man sinne entred first in-to this world, and thurgh that sinne deeth, right so thilke deeth entred in-to alle men that sinneden.' / and this man was adam, by whom sinne entred in-to this world whan he brak the comaundement of god. / and therfore, he that first was so mighty that he sholde not have dyed, bicam swich oon that he moste nedes dye, whether he wolde or noon; and all his progenie in this world that in thilke man sinneden. / loke that in thestaat of innocence, when adam and eve naked weren in paradys, and no-thing ne hadden shame of hir nakednesse, /"

22,1,"agayns glotonye is the remedie abstinence, as seith galien; but that holde i nat meritorie, if he do it only for the hele of his body. seint augustin wole, that abstinence be doon for vertu and with pacience. / abstinence, he seith, is litel worth, but if a man have good wil ther-to, and but it be enforced by pacience and by charitee, and that men doon it for godes sake, and in hope to have the blisse of hevene. /"
22,2,"the felawes of abstinence been attemperaunce, that holdeth the mene in alle thinges: eek shame, that eschueth alle deshonestee: suffisance, that seketh no riche metes ne drinkes, ne dooth no fors of to outrageous apparailinge of mete. / mesure also, that restreyneth by resoun the deslavee appetyt of etinge: sobrenesse also, that restreyneth the outrage of drinke: / sparinge also, that restreyneth the delicat ese to sitte longe at his mete and softely; wherfore som folk stonden of hir owene wil, to eten at the lasse leyser. /"
22,3,sequitur de luxuria.
22,0,
22,1,"after glotonye, thanne comth lecherie; for thise two sinnes been so ny cosins, that ofte tyme they wol nat departe. / god woot, this sinne is ful displesaunt thing to god; for he seyde himself, 'do no lecherie.' and therfore he putte grete peynes agayns this sinne in the olde lawe. / if womman thral were taken in this sinne, she sholde be beten with staves to the deeth. and if she were a gentil womman, she sholde be slayn with stones. and if she were a bisshoppes doghter, she sholde been brent, by goddes comandement. / forther over, by the sinne of lecherie, god dreynte al the world at the diluge. and after that, he brente fyve citees with thonder-leyt, and sank hem in-to helle. /"
22,2,"now lat us speke thanne of thilke stinkinge sinne of lecherie that men clepe avoutrie of wedded folk, that is to seyn, if that oon of hem be wedded, or elles bothe. /"
22,3,"this is that other hand of the devel, with fyve fingres, to cacche the peple to his vileinye. / the firste finger is the fool lookinge of the fool womman and of the fool man, that sleeth, right as the basilicok sleeth folk by the venim of his sighte; for the coveitise of eyen folweth the coveitise of the herte. / the seconde finger is the vileyns touchinge in wikkede manere; and ther-fore seith salomon, that who-so toucheth and handleth a womman, he fareth lyk him that handleth the scorpioun that stingeth and sodeynly sleeth thurgh his enveniminge; as who-so toucheth warm pich, it shent hise fingres. / the thridde, is foule wordes, that fareth lyk fyr, that right anon brenneth the herte. /"
22,4,remedium contra peccatum luxurie.
22,0,
22,1,"now comth the remedie agayns lecherie, and that is, generally, chastitee and continence, that restreyneth alle the desordeynee moevinges that comen of fleshly talentes. /"
22,2,"first, for mariage is figured bitwixe crist and holy chirche. and that other is, for a man is heved of a womman; algate, by ordinaunce it sholde be so. / for if a womman had mo men than oon, thanne sholde she have mo hevedes than oon, and that were an horrible thing biforn god; and eek a womman ne mighte nat plese to many folk at ones. and also ther ne sholde nevere be pees ne reste amonges hem; for everich wolde axen his owene thing. / and forther-over, no man ne sholde knowe his owene engendrure, ne who sholde have his heritage; and the womman sholde been the lasse biloved, fro the time that she were conioynt to many men. /"
22,3,"now comth, how that a man sholde bere him with his wyf; and namely, in two thinges, that is to seyn in suffraunce and reverence, as shewed crist whan he made first womman. /"
22,4,"now how that a womman sholde be subget to hir housbonde, that telleth seint peter. first, in obedience. /"
22,5,"the seconde manere of chastitee is for to been a clene widewe, and eschue the embracinges of man, and desyren the embracinge of iesu crist. / thise been tho that han been wyves and han forgoon hir housbondes, and eek wommen that han doon lecherie and been releeved by penitence. /"
22,6,"another remedie agayns lecherie is, specially to withdrawen swiche thinges as yeve occasion to thilke vileinye; as ese, etinge and drinkinge; for certes, whan the pot boyleth strongly, the beste remedie is to withdrawe the fyr. slepinge longe in greet quiete is eek a greet norice to lecherie. /"
22,7,"another remedie agayns lecherie is, that a man or a womman eschue the companye of hem by whiche he douteth to be tempted; for al-be-it so that the dede is withstonden, yet is ther greet temptacioun. / soothly a whyt wal, al-though it ne brenne noght fully by stikinge of a candele, yet is the wal blak of the leyt. / ful ofte tyme i rede, that no man truste in his owene perfeccioun, but he be stronger than sampson, and holier than david, and wyser than salomon. /"
22,8,"now after that i have declared yow, as i can, the sevene deedly sinnes, and somme of hir braunches and hir remedies, soothly, if i coude, i wolde telle yow the ten comandements. / but so heigh a doctrine i lete to divines. nathelees, i hope to god they been touched in this tretice, everich of hem alle. /"
22,9,de confessione.
22,0,
22,1,"now for-as-muche as the second partie of penitence stant in confessioun of mouth, as i bigan in the firste chapitre, i seye, seint augustin seith: / sinne is every word and every dede, and al that men coveiten agayn the lawe of iesu crist; and this is for to sinne in herte, in mouth, and in dede, by thy fyve wittes, that been sighte, heringe, smellinge, tastinge or savouringe, and felinge. / now is it good to understonde that that agreggeth muchel every sinne. /"
22,2,"another circumstaunce is this; whether it be doon in fornicacioun, or in avoutrie, or noon; incest, or noon; mayden, or noon; in manere of homicyde, or noon; horrible grete sinnes, or smale; and how longe thou hast continued in sinne. / the thridde circumstaunce is the place ther thou hast do sinne; whether in other mennes hous or in thyn owene; in feeld or in chirche, or in chirche-hawe; in chirche dedicat, or noon. / for if the chirche be halwed, and man or womman spille his kinde inwith that place by wey of sinne, or by wikked temptacion, the chirche is entredited til it be reconciled by the bishop; /"
22,3,"thanne shal man looke and considere, that if he wole maken a trewe and a profitable confessioun, ther moste be foure condiciouns. / first, it moot been in sorweful bitternesse of herte, as seyde the king ezekias to god: 'i wol remembre me alle the yeres of my lyf in bitternesse of myn herte.' / this condicioun of bitternesse hath fyve signes. the firste is, that confessioun moste be shamefast, nat for to covere ne hyden his sinne, for he hath agilt his god and defouled his soule. / and her-of seith seint augustin: 'the herte travailleth for shame of his sinne'; and for he hath greet shamefastnesse, he is digne to have greet mercy of god. /"
22,4,"the seconde condicion of verray confession is, that it be hastily doon; for certes, if a man hadde a deedly wounde, evere the lenger that he taried to warisshe him-self, the more wolde it corrupte and haste him to his deeth; and eek the wounde wolde be the wors for to hele. / and right so fareth sinne, that longe tyme is in a man unshewed. / certes, a man oghte hastily shewen hise sinnes for manye causes; as for drede of deeth, that cometh ofte sodenly, and is in no certeyn what tyme it shal be, ne in what place; and eek the drecchinge of o synne draweth in another; /"
22,5,"also the verray shrifte axeth certeine condiciouns. first, that thou shryve thee by thy free wil, noght constreyned, ne for shame of folk, ne for maladie, ne swiche thinges; for it is resoun that he that trespasseth by his free wil, that by his free wil he confesse his trespas; / and that noon other man telle his sinne but he him-self, ne he shal nat nayte ne denye his sinne, ne wratthe him agayn the preest for his amonestinge to leve sinne. / the seconde condicioun is, that thy shrift be laweful; that is to seyn, that thou that shryvest thee, and eek the preest that hereth thy confessioun, been verraily in the feith of holy chirche; / and that a man ne be nat despeired of the mercy of iesu crist, as caym or iudas. /"
22,6,"thou ne shall nat eek make no lesinges in thy confessioun; for humilitee, per-aventure, to seyn that thou hast doon sinnes of whiche that thou were nevere gilty. / for seint augustin seith: if thou, by cause of thyn humilitee, makest lesinges on thy-self, though thou ne were nat in sinne biforn, yet artow thanne in sinne thurgh thy lesinges. /"
22,7,"explicit secunda pars penitencie; et sequitur tercia pars eiusdem, de satisfaccione."
22,0,
22,1,"now have i told you of verray confessioun, that is the seconde partie of penitence. /"
22,2,"the thridde partie of penitence is satisfaccioun; and that stant most generally in almesse and in bodily peyne. / now been ther three manere of almesses; contricion of herte, where a man offreth himself to god; another is, to han pitee of defaute of hise neighebores; and the thridde is, in yevinge of good conseil goostly and bodily, where men han nede, and namely in sustenaunce of mannes fode. /"
22,3,"thise almesses shaltow doon of thyne owene propre thinges, and hastily, and prively if thou mayst; / but nathelees, if thou mayst nat doon it prively, thou shalt nat forbere to doon almesse though men seen it; so that it be nat doon for thank of the world, but only for thank of iesu crist. /"
22,4,"now as to speken of bodily peyne, it stant in preyeres, in wakinges, in fastinges, in vertuouse techinges of orisouns. / and ye shul understonde, that orisouns or preyeres is for to seyn a pilous wil of herte, that redresseth it in god and expresseth it by word outward, to remoeven harmes and to han thinges espirituel and durable, and somtyme temporel thinges; of whiche orisouns, certes, in the orisoun of the pater-noster, hath iesu crist enclosed most thinges. / certes, it is privileged of three thinges in his dignitee, for which it is more digne than any other preyere; for that iesu crist him-self maked it; /"
22,5,"this preyere moste be trewely seyd and in verray feith, and that men preye to god ordinatly and discreetly and devoutly; and alwey a man shal putten his wil to be subget to the wille of god. /"
22,6,"after this, thou shalt understonde, that bodily peyne stant in wakinge; for iesu crist seith, 'waketh, and preyeth that ye ne entre in wikked temptacioun.' / ye shul understanden also, that fastinge stant in three thinges; in forberinge of bodily mete and drinke, and in forberinge of worldly iolitee, and in forberinge of deedly sinne; this is to seyn, that a man shal kepen him fro deedly sinne with al his might. /"
22,7,"and thou shalt understanden eek, that god ordeyned fastinge; and to fastinge appertenen foure thinges. /"
22,8,"thanne shaltow understonde, that bodily peyne stant in disciplyne or techinge, by word or by wrytinge, or in ensample. also in weringe of heyres or of stamin, or of haubergeons on hir naked flesh, for cristes sake, and swiche manere penances. / but war thee wel that swiche manere penances on thy flesh ne make nat thyn herte bitter or angry or anoyed of thy-self; for bettre is to caste awey thyn heyre, than for to caste away the sikernesse of iesu crist. / and therfore seith seint paul: 'clothe yow, as they that been chosen of god, in herte of misericorde, debonairetee, suffraunce, and swich manere of clothinge'; of whiche iesu crist is more apayed than of heyres, or haubergeons, or hauberkes. /"
22,9,"thanne is disciplyne eek in knokkinge of thy brest, in scourginge with yerdes, in knelinges, in tribulacions; /"
22,10,"thanne shaltow understonde, whiche thinges destourben penaunce; and this is in foure maneres, that is, drede, shame, hope, and wanhope, that is, desperacion. / and for to speke first of drede; for which he weneth that he may suffre no penaunce; / ther-agayns is remedie for to thinke, that bodily penaunce is but short and litel at regard of the peyne of helle, that is so cruel and so long, that it lasteth with-outen ende. /"
22,11,"now again the shame that a man hath to shryven him, and namely, thise ypocrites that wolden been holden so parfite that they han no nede to shryven hem; /"
22,12,"now for to speken of the hope of hem that been necligent and slowe to shryven hem, that stant in two maneres. /"
22,13,"wanhope is in two maneres: the firste wanhope is in the mercy of crist; that other is that they thinken, that they ne mighte nat longe persevere in goodnesse. /"
22,14,"thanne shal men understonde what is the fruit of penaunce; and, after the word of iesu crist, it is the endelees blisse of hevene, / ther ioye hath no contrarioustee of wo ne grevaunce, ther alle harmes been passed of this present lyf; ther-as is the sikernesse fro the peyne of helle; ther-as is the blisful companye that reioysen hem everemo, everich of otheres ioye; / ther-as the body of man, that whylom was foul and derk, is more cleer than the sonne; ther-as the body, that whylom was syk, freele, and feble, and mortal, is inmortal, and so strong and so hool that ther may no-thing apeyren it; / ther-as ne is neither hunger, thurst, ne cold, but every soule replenissed with the sighte of the parfit knowinge of god. / this blisful regne may men purchace by poverte espirituel, and the glorie by lowenesse; the plentee of ioye by hunger and thurst, and the reste by travaille; and the lyf by deeth and mortificacion of sinne. /"
22,15,here taketh the makere of this book his leve.
22,0,
22,1,"now preye i to hem alle that herkne this litel tretis or rede, that if ther be any thing in it that lyketh hem, that ther-of they thanken oure lord iesu crist, of whom procedeth al wit and al goodnesse. / and if ther be any thing that displese hem, i preye hem also that they arrette it to the defaute of myn unconninge, and nat to my wil, that wolde ful fayn have seyd bettre if i hadde had conninge. / for oure boke seith, 'al that is writen is writen for oure doctrine'; and that is myn entente. / wherfore i biseke yow mekely for the mercy of god, that ye preye for me, that crist have mercy on me and foryeve me my giltes: / —and namely, of my translacions and endytinges of worldly vanitees, the whiche i revoke in my retracciouns: /"
