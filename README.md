# Voynich Attack
The Voynich Manuscript is the Holy Grail of cipher mysteries. Dating from the late Middle Ages (*maybe*), the manuscript sports bizarre illustrations of extraterrestrial-looking plants, bevies of nude beauties bathing in networks of tubes, and thousands upon thousands of “words” written in an utterly unknown alphabet. 

By all the laws of cryptology, the Voynich should have been cracked decades ago. It never has. Not a single, solitary word has ever been deciphered, despite drawing the gaze of the world's preeminent cryptographic agencies and the internet's most obsessive amateurs. What harm, then, in one more foray, however foolish, into this most enchantingly cryptic enigma?
